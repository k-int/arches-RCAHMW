705179,,705179,Llanelli,"Machynys is located to the south of Llanelli, on the waterfront. It has changed dramatically since the nineteenth century. The first edition of the 25-inch OS maps (published in 1880) shows a heavily industrialised area, with buildings such as Brickfield Chemical Works; Burry Works (Tinplate) NPRN 404317; Morfa Foundry (Iron) NPRN 40415;  South Wales Works (Iron and Tin) (NPRN 40408);  some coal yards and a wharf (NPRN 34222). There were also a small number of residential buildings, notably Dock Terrace and Brick Row. When the second edition of the 25 inch Ordance Survey map was published in 1907, the large industrial works remained, but there was more residential settlement. A school had appeared near Brick Row, as well as a Mission Room and a Calvinistic MethodisT Chapel (NPRN 6446).

Abernant Colliery had opened nearby by the time the second edition of the 6-inch Ordnance Survey was published in 1901. Four roads of terraced houses had appeared on the site of Pen-y-Werlod Farm by the time the third edition of the 6-inch orndance map was published in 1922, and this small community is labelled 'Markham Village'. By the time the fourth edition was published (1938-45), the village had expanded and Berllan-Lwyd farm had disappeared. Markam village now had a post office, a school and a club, although the colliery is labelled as disused. There were a number of places of worship in the village: St John's Church (12827); Abrenant Road Chapel (12828); Markham Methodist Chapel (307558) and an Independent Chapel (12826).

705210,,705210,Newbridge,"Trecelyn (Newbridge) is a town and community in the county of Caerphilly. It is borded by Crumlin to the north, Blackwood to the west, and Abercarn to the south. The first edition of the 25-inch Ordnance Survey map, published in 1879, depict a fairly small, scattered community. Newbridge had a railway station on the Monmouthshire section of the Western Valleys line. Other amenities included a school for boys and girls, a post office and two chapels: Beulah Welsh Baptist Chapel (NPRN 10841) and another Baptist Chapel (NPRN 13117). There were a number of 'old coal levels' marked in the area, in addition to old coke ovens and a working colliery - Cwm Dows Colliery. Newbridge also had a corn mill. The second edition, published in 1901, shows a large expansion to the west of the community, in the form of several rows of terraced houses, a new school, an inn and the Newbridge Hotel. There was also an expansion in choices of places to worship: Zion Congregational Chapel (NPRN 13115); Deml Calvinistic Methodist Chapel (NPRN 10843); and Newbridge Welsh Church (NPRN 421316). At the northen end of the town, a new public house is recorded - the Beaufort Arms - and another church, dedicated to St Pauls (NPRN 421315). Some allotment gardens are recorded just south of the corn mill. Yet more residential development had occured by the time the third edition was published in 1920, and rows of terraced houses now stretched from the edge of Twyn-gwyn Colliery in the west to the railway station in the east. A large public park is recorded opposite the railway station,and more amenities have been developed. These include a bank, an institute, a club, and another hotel. A Pentecostal chapel is recorded between the station and the allotment gardens. The town continued to expand into the twenty first century and now has amenities such as a doctor's surgery, three schools: Tynewydd Primary School, Pantside Primary School and Newbridge Comprehensive school, as well as a leisure centre. The town also has convenience shops and takeaways.

705237,,705237,Gelligaer,"Penpedairheol is a village just south of Bargoed. The name 'Penpedairheol' means 'Head of Four Roads' and indeed, at the heart of the village is a square where the B4254 meets Hospital Road to the north west and Hengoed Road to the south east. The first edition of the 25-inch Ordnance Survey map shows that in 1875, Penpedairheol was a very small settelement, centred around the square. It had a public house on the crossroads, called Plough & Harrow, and a small number of houses. An old coal level is recorded just to the east, and an old tramway runs past the south of the village. By the time the third edition of the 25 inch Ordnance Survey map was published in 1920, several more dwellings had been built in the village. To the east, about 60 terraced houses had been built, centred around Pendarren Street. Terraced houses had also been built along Hengoed Road and immediately to the east of Plough & Harrow. About half a kilometer to the north, Gelligaer U.D. Council's Isolation is noted. The village continued to expand rapidly throughout the twentieth century. In the twenty-first century, Penpedairheol is a large village with amenities. The Plough & Harrow public house is still open, and has been joined by a social club, a fish and chip shop, a butchers, a cornershop, a car dealership and a primary school - Glyn-Gaer, which educated approximately 235 pupils.

705299,,705299,Sully,"Swanbridge is a small hamlet south east of Sully and south west of Penarth. It once had a slipway and there are records of shipping operating in the area from C16. Kelp was prepared by burning seaweed in pits - 1 ton of kelp from 20 tons of seaweed - and exported. Other exports were local plants, including sea-holly, sent to Bristol for medicines. Main exports in C17 and C18 were cheese, butter, wool, woollen goods and livestock. Coastal trade declined at end of C18 with closure of ferry between Sully and Uphill on the other side of the Bristol ChannelThe first four editions of the 25-inch Ordanance Survey maps (published between 1879 and 1943) show that there was very little change in the area from the late nineteneth century to the mid twentieth century. There are three named properties in the area: The Spinny, Sully House, and Swanbridge. Modern OS maps reveal a dramatic change. In the twenty-first century the hamlet is dominated by two caravan parks: The Spinney Holiday Park and Island View Caravan Park. Amenities include a public house called The Captains Wife, a restaurant called 'On the Rocks ""Pink Floyd"" Bar, and a cafe called 'Seashore Grill.' Sully House has been demolished, and Swanbridge farm appears to have been extensively redeveloped.

705314,,705314,Ynysawdre,"Tondu is located nearly five miles north of Bridgend town centre, borderd to the south by Aberkenfig and to the east by Sarn. The first edition of the 25-inch Ordnance Survey map, published in 1877, show that the village was domiated by Tondû Iron Works (NPRN 34119), and other signs of industrialisation include Evanstown Brickworks, a gas works and a station (NPRN 34882) on the Porthcawl and Llynfi branches of the Great Western Railway. There was also a saw mill called Felin Fâch to the east of the village. There were three chapels, all located in the southern part of Tondu: Carew English Baptist Chapel (NPRN 10013); the Welsh Baptist Capel Jerusalem (NPRN 10014) and a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel (NPRN 10019). Little had changed by the time the second edition of the 25-inch Ordnance Survey maps was published in 1899, and the most notable addition to the third edition (published in 1919) was a school, built between Weslseyan Methodist Chapel and Jersualem Chapel. The fourth edition, published in 1942, shows that the Ironworks had been replaced by an engineering works, and the coke ovens immediatley to the west had become a 'coke and by-product works.' Numerous allotment gardens had developed to the south of the village, a Parish Room is noted next to the sawmill, and there is a 'boys club' near the railway station. In the twenty-first century, the village has continued to develop. The bricksworks has been replaced by a Lidl and a street named 'clos gwaith brics'. The area which onces housed the cokeworks, ironworks and engineering works has become a wooded area called 'Tondu Iron Park.' The railway station remains open, although there is only one platform now with no amenities, on the line between Maesteg and Bridgend. An enterprise park has been built on the site of the old colliery, and the Methodist chapel and the Parish Hall remain open. Other amenities in Tondu now include a cricket club, a youth centre, a primary school and a community college (on the site of Adare College), and a public house called the Llyfni Arms, ",English Description,MP,,,,POINT (-3.5949508 51.546739),SS8984,,Grid reference taken at a central point within extensive site or complex,SS88SE,No preference,Multiperiod,Documents,,VILLAGE,"Tondu, Aberkenfig",,,Glamorgan,SS8950084300,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,No Preference,No Preference,,,Glamorgan,MP,e8d11556-543b-4672-9b1d-24796480045e
