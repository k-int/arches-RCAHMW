710074,710074,"The original gasworks was on Dan-Y-Rhiw terrace, which had consisted of a horizontal retort house and two gasholders, one of which was later used as an underground tar and liquor tank. The site expanded across the River Ebbw, where two larger gasholders were built, both having a 250,000 capacity. <br><br>
The Western Mail from the 21st of November 1876 reported on the formation of the company” On the 25th of January last the Abercarn and Newbridge Gas and Water Company, Limited, was formed to supply Abercarn and Newbridge with gas and water. The subject had been several times mooted, for the district was known to be growing, and both gas and water were felt to be requisites which could not be done without. A few earnest men connected with the district put their heads together, and, after some encouragement was given to the project by Lady Llanover, the company was formed on the day above named. The capital was fixed at £10,000 in 2,000 shares of £5 each.”,” Half-an-acre of land was purchased from Lady Llanover, on advantageous terms, between Hall's Tramway and the river Ebbw”,” Mr. Dyne Steel designed the works, which have been built most substantially, and with every necessary for increasing their capacity when the time arrives. The works consist of a retort house, 23ft. 6ins. by 25ft., and has accommodation for three benches of live retorts each. At present eight retorts are at work, leaving the remainder for future extension. From the retorts the gas passes into the condenser and scrubber. The gasholder is 46ffc. diameter, and 12ft. deep, and is equal to a very large consumption of gas. The mains are graduated from seven to two inches in diameter, according to the position they occupy. The mains have been carried along the roads, with the permission of the highway authorities and the overseers. Mr. Robert Roberts, of Newport, has carried out the buildings in a satisfactory manner, the stone for which has been obtained from the Pennant rock at Abercarn, the quoins and arches being of fire bricks. The gas-making plant has been supplied by Messrs. Porter and Company, Lincoln, and has been, well set up by Mr. E. Woodthorpe, their agent. The retort mouth pieces are Tangye's patent. The mains were made by Mr. Charles Jordan, of Newport, and they were laid by Mr. Jesse Bailey, of Abercarn.”. The company being promoted by the Abercarn Colliery and the Tinplate Works. The contractor for the gasworks was Charles Jordan of Newport and the laying of the gas mains was contracted to Jesse Bailey of the Abercarn Colliery, who was also active in procuring lamp posts for the company.  The Abercarn & Newbridge Gas & Water Company Ltd. was incorporated by a SA in 1884. At this time J. T. Green was the Chairman and David Bowen, the Secretary of the company. 'Abercarn & Newbridge' were one of the towns where the gas engineers J. T. B. Porter & Co. of Lincoln listed that they had built complete gasworks, in an advert published in 1878. <br><br>
By 1900 the company was making 17m cu.ft. from 2,285 tons of coal annually and supplying 214 consumers and 200 public gas lamps, through 8 miles of mains. Charles Jones was the Manager and David Bowen, the Secretary.<br><br>
A SA of 1902 enabled the Abercarn UDC to purchase the company. The council run gas department was making 38m cu.ft. of gas per year from 3,368 tons of coal, supplied via a rail siding into the works from the GWR. Thomas Wilkinson was both the Engineer & Manager. Between 1919 and 1923 two Tully gas plants, each capable of producing 150,000 cu.ft./day of gas were supplied by Tully Gas Plants Ltd., Newark, according to a company advert dated Sept 1923. In 1946 a Bulk Supply Agreement was signed with the Pontypool Gas & Water Co. and an 8"" high pressure main was laid to Abercarn from Cwmbran, which was itself fed from Pontypool. Much of the gas came from coke ovens at Blaenavon.<br><br>
By 1947 the amount of gas purchased (46m cu.ft.) was greater than that made at the gasworks (27m cu.ft.). By 1949, the year the gas industry was nationalised 84m cu.ft. of gas was being purchased, although the gasworks still had Horizontal retorts. T. Wilkinson was the Engineer, Manager & Secretary for the undertaking. The undertaking was vested in the Wales Gas Board in 1949 following nationalisation. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Abercarn was purchasing 160m cu.ft. of gas from other works and no gas manufacture was being undertaken. T. Wilkinson was the engineer, manager & secretary. The gasholders were still in operation in 1983. Photographs of the gasworks and later gasholder station in 1983 survive at the National Grid Gas Archive.   An additional gasholder is present on south side of river by 1916 (321226,195062) were present until 1993. Original site gone by 1981. The gasworks were visible on the OS maps from 1879 to 1993.",English Description
710075,710075,"The first gasworks in the Aberdare area were built by the Aberdare Gas Company at Tudor Place, Abergwawr in 1849. The original gasmaking plant was supplied by the Neath Abbey Ironworks; whose drawings are held by the West Glamorgan Archive Service (ref GB 216 DD NAI/2/1/hub). These gasworks were marked on the 1869 and 1878 OS map and consisted of two buildings and three circular structures (gasometers). The Aberdare and Aberaman Gas Act of 1869 formed a new company, the Aberdare, and Aberaman Consumers Gas Company, who established a new gasworks. The Original Aberdare Gas company did not have Statutory power to dig up the roads to install or replace gas mains, so had to apply in 1871 through the Aberdare Gas Bill, at this time Mr. Robinson was the manager of the of Gasworks. The Tudor Place gasworks closed in the 1870’s and was replaced by a row of houses on Tudor place, with no evidence of the former gasworks.",English Description
710076,710076,"The Aberaman Gasworks were built on a former colliery tip associated with Tre-Aman Colliery. These gasworks were built by the Aberdare and Aberaman Gas Consumers Company which was formed in 1869 by Special Act and these gasworks were reported to have been built by 1871, although they don’t appear on OS maps until 1898. In 1913 the annual gas production of gas was 104m cu.ft., from 10,579 tons of coal, with cannel coal used to enrich the gas. The undertaking provided a meter, cooker and 4 gas lights free to consumers on slot meters. The company supplied 567 public gas streetlamps. The gasworks had four and 44 miles of mains. T.P. White was Chairman and A.E. Davey, Engineer, Manager & Secretary. The control of the company was acquired by the UKGC Corporation.<br><br>
In 1949 the annual gas production was 120 cu.ft.. D. E. West was Engineer & general Manager and J. R. Munro the Secretary. In 1950 c50m cu.ft. of coke oven gas was received from the NCB Phurnacite plant at Aberdare, this increased in 1951 and with supply from Nantgarw, it enabled coal gas production at Aberaman to cease. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Aberdare was purchasing 86m cu.ft. of gas from coke ovens and 147m cu.ft. of gas was being made using horizontal retorts. D. T. Phillips was engineer and manager. Jones and Reeves reported that the opening of the Nantgarw coke ovens by the NCB allowed these works to close in 1951. The site now used by Rhondda Cynon Taff County Borough Council.  The gasworks were visible on the OS maps from 1898 to 2021. An additional gasholder to south east of river was constructed between 1964 and 1969.",English Description
710077,710077,"The gasworks were built west of the town c1865. On the 30th of May 1865, the partly built gasworks at Aberdovey were to be auctioned, whilst the gas mains to the town had already been laid JGL. The gasworks in Aberdovey were operated by the Dysynni Gas Co. Ltd. Slater's 1895 Directory listed George E. Woodford as Company Secretary to the Dysynni Gas Co. Ltd. As well as the Barmouth Gas Co. Ltd.; the Dolgelly Gas Co. Ltd.; and the Rhos Gas Co. Ltd. All these companies were run by the industrialist Henry Dyke Dennis, of New Hall in Ruabon, and the company offices of all of Dennis' companies were in High Street, Ruabon. Circa 1920 a photograph showed a single-lift column guided holder in a steel tank. The retort house chimney still stood, but the roof and part of the retort house walls had gone. The gasworks had closed c1900. The gas supply was maintained, with gas supply from the gasworks at Towyn which supplied a gasholder at the site. A spiral-guided holder of 40,000 cu.ft. capacity was still in use in 1977 but was demolished about late-1982.  The gasworks were visible on the OS maps from 1887 to 1902, with the gasholder station to the north visible from 1938 until 1982.",English Description
710078,710078,"A gas works was built as a private concern in 1823 by Thomas Davies who the commissioners contracted to light the town streets with gas (instead of the oil lamps used since 1796).  A report on the sanitary condition of the town of Abergavenny from 1847, stated the gasworks were built by Mr Simeon Broadmeadow, who used brick ovens (instead of iron), a steam powered exhauster to remove gas from the ovens and a novel method to purify the gas, which introduced air via the exhauster to precipitate sulphur in the gasometer tank. Both the brick oven and purifying method not overly successful and the gasworks had to revert to traditional methods at great expense. The exhauster concept became widely adopted and brick-built ovens (retorts) were also adopted in later years.  In 1854 an IA authorised the construction of a new gasworks. Mordecai Jones owned the gasworks and was chairman until his death in 1880. The company obtained SA in 1860 & 1871. In 1884 the Foundation date of the gasworks was quoted as ""Improvement Commission, 1863"", Edwin Tucker was the Chairman and Samuel Cross the Manager. In 1893	the gas undertaking was acquired by Urban District Council. A rail siding was constructed from the L&NWR by 1899. Biggs, Wall & Co advertised that they had supplied a manual charging machine (for horizontal retorts) to Abergavenny by 1906. In 1949, 130m cu.ft. of gas was made, D. Howells, Engineer & Manager and the gasworks was now using Vertical retorts. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Abergavenny was purchasing 1m cu.ft. of gas from other works and was manufacturing 111m cu.ft. of gas using vertical retort plant. A. D. Howells was engineer and manager. A photograph of the site c1950, shows a vertical retort house, two GH, one spiral guided and one frame guided, 4 annular condensers and 4 box purifiers. In 1954 the HP gas mains from Pontypool were extended using 8"" diameter pipes from Blaenavon to Abergavenny, allowing the works to close. A further 3.5"" steel main was laid the 18.5 miles of 3.5"" from Abergavenny to Brecon.  The gasworks were visible on the OS maps from 1880 to 1969, the site was noted as 'Gasholder Station' in 1973.",English Description
710079,710079,"The Gas Company was formed in 1859 as a limited liability company, subscription to the share came from the local inhabitant as recorded in the Wrexham and Denbighshire Advertiser of the 26th February 1859 “ A Gas Company has been formed in this town under the Limited Liability Act, with the view of building Gas Works. The capital is to be £2,000, in shares of £5 each, the whole of which is subscribed by the inhabitants.

Mr Jones, Brynffanigl, is to be the chairman of the directors, and Mr J. Edwards, draper, secretary, pro tern.” The gasworks originally built by W. C. Holmes, gas engineer of Huddersfield.  The town was lit by November 1859. According to Kelly’s directory in 1895 Edward Hugh Millward was Secretary. By 1900the gasworks also supplied Pensarn. In 1922 ""The Abergele Urban Council have kept the town in darkness at night for a month or so, as a mild protest against the charge of 8s.4d. per 1,000 cu.ft. by the Gas Company. Seeing there were no hopes of a reduction, they have now renewed the lighting"" (GJ 1922). In 1933 the annual gas sales were 6.5m cu.ft. to a population of 2,600. 485 consumers of whom 400 had cookers, 717 tons of coal was carbonised in horizontal retorts and the gasworks had two GH total 25,000 cu.ft..

710080,710080,"The first gasworks started on land north on Tondu Iron Works, shown on the 1875 OS map as having two gasholders. The site then spread east to land across the Feeder channel where further gasholder had been built by 1897. The Garw & Ogmore Gas Company was formed in 1891 by SA, with the first gas manufactured in 1895. The gasworks were evidently in operation privately before the formation of the company. An article in the Glamorgan Gazette of the 27th of December 1907, “proposes that the company may acquire by agreement the supply of gas in the district now supplied by the existing private gasworks belonging to North's Navigation Company, Limited, situated at Tondu.” The gasworks had a private siding into the works through the Tondu Iron Works. In 1914 the Garw and Ogmore Gas Company invited tenders for the purchase of the disused gas works plant at Pontycymmer (GW). (This appears to refer to obsolete plant for sale on the original site, then known as Pontycymmer). The Garw and Ogmore obtained a purified supply of gas from the Tondu Colliery plant in the interwar years but retained their horizontal retort plant. The Tondu coke ovens provided more gas than required and this was sold on to Bridgend, through a gas main which linked the Garw gasworks with those at Bridgend. The gasworks were visible on the OS maps from 1876 to 1948.",English Description

The gasworks land was leased from the Corporation, the first gas being made in 1838 from just three retorts.  John Brunton was appointed in 1839 to inspect the works before it was handed over from the contractors. Initially 80 gas streetlamps were installed, and gas was supplied to a few private houses were lit by gas. Gas meters were soon used supplied by Wm. Parkinson of Cottage Lane, City Road, London. An OS map of 1886 showed the gasworks had two gasometers and a central retort house, accessed from Smithfield Road. Cola would have been carted from the depot to the gasworks. Coal was originally supplied by ship. The railways did not reach Aberystwyth until 1864 (Cambrian Railway) and 1867 (Manchester and Milford railway). The gasworks were enlarged in 1870.  In 1881 Hugh Hughes was Chairman, James Dougall was Manager and R. J. Jones was Secretary. The company retained Henry Woodall as Consultant in 1895, who advised that a new site should be sought, and a parliamentary Bill was promoted.

With what degree this end has been attained may be realised from the fact that the production of gas could be readily increased to double, treble, or even quadruple that provided for by the carbonizing section. The buildings at present consist of a retort house, about 100 feet in length by 73 in width (this for the time serving as retort house and coal stores combined), engine, exhauster, boiler houses, workshops, stores, photometer, and testing room, and meter, and governor house. There are other buildings to be erected, but these with the exception of the offices and show rooms for fittings, gas stoves, etc. are not absolutely necessary for the present. As the offices will serve for the joint Gas and Water undertakings”. The Barry and Cadoxton Local Board (Gas and Water) Bill went through parliament in 1894 for the compulsory purchase of the Barry Gas and Water Company (Barry Dock News 1894). In 1896 the annual gas production was 28m cu.ft. from 2,800 tons of coal. 530 consumers. Mr F. M. Harris was Engineer, Manager & Secretary. In 1900 the annual gas production was 76.6m cu.ft. from 7,303 tons of coal, the illuminating power was 16cp. There were 3,178 consumers of whom 2,244 had slot meters. 686 public lamps. Mr. F. M.

Walcott and Van Senden, erect small gasworks for lighting isolated mansions, hotels, factories etc and fit up the inside of houses for gas at a reasonable rate, with superior gas fittings, tubing and workmanship, office 25 Laurence Poutney Lane, Cannon Street, London. This suggests that Walcott was the gas engineer responsible for building the gasworks. In 1857 the gas supply was commenced by Sir Richard Williams Bulkeley, Bart., to supply 'Barron Hill', the family home. His family continued the public supply which was given from this works. George Walcott was still advertised in 1859 as engineer/manager of the Beaumaris gasworks. In 1881 T. Walker, Manager.

This experiment may have led the formation of the company behind the Blaenau Ffestiniog gasworks, which was formed in 1862.  Dates from at least 1870 when G. S. Jones, Dolgarregddu. was representing the new Blaenau Ffestiniog Gas Company. The gasworks were built in 1871 according to a report in the Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard from the 18th of March 1871 “The annoyance so long felt at Blaenau from the want of gas during the dark winter nights will shortly be removed. At a meeting held some months ago, the subject of introducing gas to the rapidly increasing neighbourhood was first mooted, and, as might be supposed, was cordially decided upon. Since that period the matter has not been allowed to remain in abeyance, and we are able now to state that the contract, which was entrusted to an eminent firm of gas engineers at Dublin, rapidly approaches completion. A large gasometer has been erected, together with the necessary buildings, retorts, &c., adjoining the viaduct of the Blaenau Railway, and the mains are now being formed.

The company agreed in principle and a Mr. Ryde, London, was appointed valuer subject to the Local Government Board agreeing to the purchase. In February 1883, Andreas Roberts gave a notice of motion advising that the project would be too costly now because of work necessary regarding drainage. In March 1884 that the Board would be taking over the Gasworks in April. In 1883 the works were Purchased by Ffestiniog UDC, under a Provisional Order. A gas Committee was formed and the ?rst members were E. P. Jones. O. R. Owen. l. Lloyd Jones, John Edwards, and David Williams. The Committee ‘s ?rst meeting was on April 2nd.1884. The Manager at the time of the takeover was David Morgan, others working at the Gas Works then were W. G. Owen and Thomas Hughes. The latter was the first of three generations to work at the Blaenau Gasworks, his son George Hughes and his grandson Bob Hughes following him there. By 1891, due probably to increasing demand because of the continuing influx of people to work in the slate quarries. The Board asked for an inspection of the gasworks by De Winton. Complaints about the supply still existed in 1892 when Warren Roberts and William Owen were asked to visit Llandudno Gas Works to glean information about the coal used and the general working of the Gasworks. Later a John Smith, from Bangor inspected the Blaenau Gasworks and suggested certain improvements. When a manager was needed in 1894 it was decided to stipulate that the new one must be an “abstainer”. In 1896 the manager reported that the demand for gas was becoming very heavy indeed. Blaenau at that time. of course. was at the zenith of its population graph. Improvements were made at the gasworks in 1907 and they continued to be run by the local council until they were nationalised.

710106,710106,"The gasworks were in existence prior 1868 and operated by the Briton Ferry Gas Company. Also, in the news in 1869” THE BRITON FERRY GAS WORKS —We understand that a reduction in the price per 1,000 feet has been made by the above company a reduction of another kind has, however, lately taken place in this town. We refer to the wretchedly reduced light supplied to the consumers indoors, as well as to the public streetlamps. The matter, it is stated, will soon be altered for the best, as the new company will shortly come into possession of the works now in charge of the old company. Public expectations are at present very high in reference to the future doings of the new proprietors, and the benefits likely to result.  (The Brecon County Times Neath Gazette and General Advertiser for the Counties 25th December 1869.) This suggests the old company had been in existence for some time. The new company was reported to have been called the “Briton Ferry Gas and Coke Consumers Company (Limited)” in the Monmouthshire Merlin 2nd December 1865. The gasworks was sold to the Briton Ferry Local Board c1873 (The Cambrian 16th November 1877). This was following a Special Act of 1873. In 1883 The Briton Ferry Local Board Gas Dept, had authorised loans of £20,000, in 1881 it had produced 5.5m cu.ft. of 17 cp gas. (The Cardiff Times 20th January 1883).<br><br>
As to the gasworks themselves, there is not a great deal to be said. When Mr. Mogford went to Briton Ferry twenty years ago, he found himself faced with the familiar uphill fight of a small works over. capitalized, which had been allowed to get into a bad state and was losing about £800 a year. The make of gas 8 m cu.ft.. per annum. This was a situation which he immediately set about to alter. For one thing, he introduced free installations, and arranged exhibitions and demonstrations. The gas output last year being between 38 and 39 m cu.ft.. There are four beds of six retorts, with shallow generators; and the make has in the twenty years gone up from 9000 cu.ft. to 11,500 cu.ft. per ton of through local coal. The exhausters are not direct-coupled, but driven by a gas-engine off shafting, which is also used to drive the rotary scrubber and all the pumps. This has been the method adopted for many years; and with this drive, and the retort-house governor, no difficulty is ever experienced. As a stand-by, an electric motor is provided; and in the same house there is another gas-engine which is used for running a mortar mill. All the pan breeze produced is utilized for mortar for the Council and anybody else who requires it. Of the two holders, one (by Messrs. W. C. Holmes & Co.) is spiral-guided and contains 280,000 cu.ft. while the capacity of the other is 75,000 cu.ft. (JGL 6/10/1908). In 1915 the annual gas production 36m cu.ft. of 16cp gas (14 prescribed) from 3,600 tons of coal.1,250 slot consumers, 450 credit consumers, 1,350 stoves in use and 210 incandescent streetlamps. 16 miles of main and two holders. J. Mogford, Engineer, Manager & Secretary. No railway into works. In 1922	the Briton Ferry UDC was absorbed by the Borough of Neath, and with it the Council's Gas Department. A trunk main was laid from Neath to Briton Ferry and the Briton Ferry gas works closed in 1924. On vesting in 1949, most of the site was conveyed by Wales Gas Board to Neath Corporation, the Ground Rent being apportioned £34 from Neath Corporation and £22 from Wales Gas Board. Vested in the Wales Gas Board from Neath Corporation In 1986	the site was empty and disused apart from a small compound housing District Regulators. The two holders had been demolished for some time. The first site smaller and in south. Expanded to the north by 1914 and original site redeveloped for residential use c.1938.

710107,710107,"In 1861 the gasworks were built by George Bower, primarily for the Brymbo Coal & Iron Co. The gasworks appears to have also been a public supply from the works.  “Some time ago the experiment was tried at the Brymbo Gas Works on a child by Mr D. Clark, the gas manager, and proved successful. Subsequently a great number of children have been cured. Last year nearly two hundred children were brought to the gas works, and during the last few weeks a great number have visited the works and have also been greatly benefitted thereby (Wrexham and Denbighshire Advertiser and Cheshire Shropshire and North Wales Register, 2nd November 1867). In 1869 Wrexham and Denbighshire Advertiser and Cheshire Shropshire and North Wales Register, reported that the Iron works which was run by William Henry Darby and Charles Edward Darby (grandsons of Abraham Darby), would not supply gas to the local pub, presumably due to their Quaker faith. In 1874 Mr D. Clarke, was the manager of the Brymbo Gasworks. In 1876 The Wrexham Guardian (5th December 1876) reported that the gas supply had failed 5 times in the last twelve months and that a gas supply may be sought from Wrexham. In 1881 George Cort was Manager. The gasworks remained visible on the OS maps from 1872 until 1912, but not afterwards.

710112,710112,"Caernarfon was recorded in the gas literature as spelt either Caernarfon, Caernarvon, or Carnarvon. The Caernarfon gasworks were built 1832 ""The first in Wales to be financed by a Local Authority"". A plate outside the works read ""GAS WORKS ERECTED IN THE YEAR 1832. The Most Hon. Henry William Marquis of Anglesey, Mayor. Wm. Roberts, Deputy Mayor. O. O. Roberts and Edward Parry Bailiffs. W. Webber Engineer. J. Lloyd, Architect."" The gas supply began in 1833, largely due to two Bailiffs Owen Owen Roberts and Edward Parry. Owen Owen Roberts later moved to Bangor where he led the introduction of gas lighting, largely for reasons of public order. The Caernarfon gasworks were later leased to private owners. There was a Special Act in 1837. The Mayor (Mr J.P. De Winton Esq) said of the gas supply “he might truly say that it was one of the worst supplied towns in the matter or gas, Carnarvon gas was a perfect disgrace to the Principality.” (The North Wales Chronicle and Advertiser for the Principality 2nd December 1871). There was a long case held about the Carnarvon Gasworks in 1875, which focussed on the mismanagement of the gasworks and its accounts. From the cases reported in the papers, it can be ascertained that the gasworks were managed from 1860 to 1875 by a Mr Crippin, the works used some cannel coal in gas making. He had been in partnership with a Mr Brothers from 1858 to 1860. Mr Crippin had bought the lease to the gasworks for £2500 in 1858 and had spent between £5000-6000 on capital expenditure at the gasworks by 1875. This expenditure had covered a purchasing a second hand gasholder and new gas mains.  There was an old gasholder built by Rettons of Blackburn which was out of operation. Both the town and harbour had stopped taking gas from the gasworks c1872. A Mr Mathew Parsons was the manager of the gasworks from 1866 to 1870 and from 1872. During his time as manage he mentioned the following were added: a purifier house and three box purifiers, retort increase from 13 to 30, a scrubber, 2nd hand exhauster and engines, three more purifiers and a new tar well and wall to stop the tar from leaking. There were a lot of gas leaks from the old gas mains. The works supplied the Morfa Slate quarries with gas.

The Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard from the 11th of June 1875 “CARNARVON GAS FOR CARNARVON’. —At a special meeting of the Carnarvon Corporation, the award of Mr (Charles) Hunt, umpire in the arbitration relative to the amount to be paid to Mr Crippin, proprietor of certain works in Carnarvon, for his interest in such undertaking, was read. The award was £5,500, considerably under the anticipated amount. Mr De Winton, chairman of the Gas Committee, stated that the purchase of the freehold, expenses of the arbitration, putting the works into working order, would be about £18,750 (inclusive of the amount of the award), while the gross annual receipts initially be estimated at £3,000. The purchase, in the first instance, would be completed by a private undertaking the Carnarvon Gas Consumers' Company - formed for the purpose of treating with Mr Crippin, and would by them be transferred to the Corporation for the use of the town.” Acquired by Carnarvon Corporation, following a Special Act of 1875. A Freehold of 0.99a at Morfa Seiout was purchased from John N. F. Astley by Caernarvon Gas Company for £5,250 on the 6th May, 1876. J. T.B. Porter & Co. of Lincoln listed Carnarvon among the towns where they had extended gas works or added a gas holder. The list was published in 1878. The situation in the gasworks does not appear to have improved much as in 1879, 1884, 1887 and 1899, residents of the town were still complaining to the local press of the poor quality of light. In 1881 Mr M.J. Parsons was the Manager. By 1887 there was a long siding into the gasworks, following the west side of St. Helen's Road. In 1895 Mr Thomas Wilkinson was listed as the Manager (Kelly). In 1899 there was support for the introduction of electricity (Carnarvon and Denbigh Herald and North and South Wales Independent 7th April 1899). In 1903 ""It was reported at the last meeting of the Carnarvon Town Council that the Gas Committee had engaged Mr. Henry Woodall to report on the abnormal leakage of gas which exists in the town. The figure rose to 15% last year and Mr. Woodall attributes this mostly to the small size and extreme age of the (gas) mains. In 1909 Mr. W.M. Ruxton was the engineer of the gasworks and had been for 12 years, he was presented a walking cane for his service (Carnarvon and Denbigh Herald and North and South Wales Independent 1st January 1909).

The street s was lighted for the first time with gas, and this was considered a most gratifying matter in the dark winter nights. But it appears that the inhabitants do not appreciate the boon, or at least the paying for it. Some parties at a distance object to pay the gas vote because they live at a distance, and say they reap no benefit from it. Many in the town have also objected to pay, and this is particularly strange, as the towns- people reap the principal benefit of streetlamps. The collector is not able to collect the needful sum to keep the lamps alight, consequently the directors have determined to leave the streets in their primitive state. It is to be hoped that the inhabitants, particularly those who have refused to pay, will reconsider the matter”. The Formation of the Caerphilly Gas Light and Water Works Co. Ltd.1869. The company was referred to as the Caerphilly Gas Light and Coke Company in 1873, when Mr. John Gibbons was the chairman (South Wales Daily News 12th September 1873).

However, this never occurred, with the latter company purchased by the Cardiff gas company. In 1898 the Rhymney & Aber Valleys Gas & Water Act incorporated that Company and authorised it to acquire the Caerphilly Gaslight, Coke & Water Co. for £6,000. The Caerphilly Gaslight and Coke and Waterworks Company (Limited) was wound up voluntarily in April 1899 (Weekly Mail 15th April 1899). Several Gas Companies were amalgamated. The Caerphilly site was abandoned in favour of a new gas works in Caerphilly at Mill Road, Energlyn. The following statistics were published in 1900 ( The Gas and Water Companies' Directory and Statistics) but appear to relate to the pre-1898 Caerphilly Company: - Annual gas production 4m cu.ft., sales 3.9m cu.ft. of 16cp gas from 425 tons of coal.

Porter & Co. of Lincoln listed Cefn Mawr and Rhos-y-Medre among the towns where they had built complete gas works. The advert containing this list was published in 1878. 1896, 6th December. 0.52a site leased from Sir Herbert Lloyd Watkin and others until 24th June 1964 @ £150 p.a. in 1919, 12th May. A further 0.45a were leased. On the 23rd of June 1933. Freehold land acquired from Monsanto Chemical Works. In 1949 the annual gas production was 64,750,000 cu.ft.. Vested in the Wales Gas Board from the Cefn Mawr and Rhos-y-Madre Gas Company Ltd. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Cefn Mawr was manufacturing 70m cu.ft. of gas using horizontal retort plant. T.R. Evans was the engineer and general manager. The gasworks ceased production in September 1953, after which it was retained as a gasholder station. 1989, 31st March. 1.27a portion of site disposed of to Wrexham Maelor Borough Council. At this time two holders remained in use, No.3 of 80,000 cu.ft. and No.4 of 100,000 cu.ft.. The old Plas Kynaston Chemical works which are in Cefn Mawr next to Wrexham. The site has history producing oils from local oil shales. The Plas Kynaston chemical works was established in 1867 by Robert Ferdinand Graesser, an industrial chemist from Saxony. The chemical works at Plas Kynaston extracted paraffin oil and wax from the local shale. The company later expanded into the production of coal tar, carbolic acid, and phenol. The site soon became the world's leading phenol producer. In 1919 the US chemical company Monsanto entered a partnership with Graesser's chemical works to produce vanillin, salicylic acid, aspirin, and later rubber.

710120,710120,"A gas company in Chepstow was formed in 1827, according to a report in the Monmouthshire Merlin (13th November 1847) it was located on the Back, this was a road by the River Wye which stretched from 353618 to 194302. The works are not visible on any old maps. 1829-31 Gas Plant supplied by Neath Abbey Ironworks; drawings held by Glamorgan Archives Service (ref GB 216 DD NAI/2/15/hub). Erected by Charles Hollis at the Meads, between the river and the later railway station site. The supply probably began in January 1831 or not long thereafter. In 1832, Charles Hollis declared bankrupt. Gas works sold to a local consortium for £1,350. Chepstow Church was lit with gas on 2/12/1832. The company was referred to as the Chepstow Gas Company In 1851. In 1856 the gasworks had been managed for some years by John and Wm. Price but there was dissatisfaction with the low gas quality or ""blue flame"". A public meeting at the Bank Building in January authorised Thomas Atkins, the Oxford Engineer, to report of local gas supplies and submit plans for improvement. As a result, it was decided to float a rival 'New Gas Company' with a capital of £5,000 in £5 shares. J. B. Snead was appointed Chairman, the Bankers were Bromage, Snead and Snead. There were serious disturbances as mains were laid. (see 'A History of Gas Production in Wales' by Jones & Reeve, pages 26-29). There was no street lighting during the winter of 1856-57, the lamps having been solen. Crime increased. In 1857 a Special Act was obtained by the (new) Chepstow New Gas Company, giving them the right to lay mains. When street lighting resumed on 6/10/1857 the new Company had the contract. Competition continued between the two concerns. Messrs. T. Atkins and Son were a Chepstow based engineering and contracting company (1856 article reports he was Oxford based), by 1858 they had erected 43 similar gasworks, the 43rd being the gasworks at Keynsham. Chepstow Gas and Coke Consumers' Company (New company) tender to light the whole of the public lamps from the 1st ultimo to the 1st of August next for the sum of £18 (Monmouthshire Merlin 14th July 1866). The new company purchased the old company in 1872. The old works is assumed to have closed shortly afterwards. The Chepstow Local Board, after endeavouring in vain to obtain a reduction of the price charged for gas by the Gas Company, resolved to try the experiment of lighting with spirits. The experiment failed, and the Board directed their clerk to re new their contract with the Gas Company (Monmouthshire Merlin 28th March 1879). In 1900 the District Council accepted the Gas Company's tender for street gas supply at £185, an increase of £20 owing to the increase in coal and wages. (South Wales Daily News 14th March 1900). The Chepstow Gas Company’s tender for lighting, cleaning, and repairing the public lamps at £42 per annum was accepted. By 1948 Chepstow gasworks had ceased production, supplied through Newport with coke oven gas. The remaining works were vested in the Wales Gas Board in 1949. Chepstow was connected to the South Wales Super Grid in 1968, which stretched to Ammanford in the West. The gasworks were visible on the 1881 to 1969 OS maps.",English Description

Bellyse, Esq, chairman, when a dividend of six per cent. per annum was declared upon the respective shares up to 31st December 1866. The company has a capital of £1,000 divided into 100 shares of 210 each, and not only supply the village with gas, but also Brynkinallt, the residence of Lord Hill Trevor. It has been enabled, through the good management and indefatigable exertions of the secretary, Mr E. Griffith (the principal promoter and contractor), to complete the works within the capital, and in seven weeks from the date of the first meeting, which was the 14th of November 1865, the greater portion of the village was lighted with gas, and the directors are now able to declare a satisfactory dividend at their first annual meeting. It appears from the revenue accounts that there is a working surplus for the current year, and the shareholders may well congratulate themselves upon their present prosperous position.” This article suggest that the gasworks had been built in 1865. The company operated as the Chirk Gas Co. Ltd. In 1915 William Parker, was the Secretary. In 1923 W. G. Lloyd was the Manager & Secretary.

Mr. John Player came forward with an offer to supply electric current at a moderate cost. The offer was accepted, and the contract for laying the mains, &c., was placed in the hands of Messrs. J. C. Howell, and Co., Limited, of Llanelly.  The current was supplied from a large dynamo of the Thomas Parker make, giving 100 amperes and 220 volts, and this is worked by means of a compound Marshall engine running at 140 revolutions per minutes and 40 horsepower, when working: under 100lbs steam pressure. The gasworks were located at the Clydach Foundry, Clydach, in the Swansea Valley. The works were one of the first to use waterpower from the Swansea Canal. The gasworks would have been owned by John Player at the time of the gasworks construction. In 1907 The Swansea Valley Gas Bill preamble included ""...and sanction will be asked for the acquisition by agreement of the supply of gas to the district now served from the private works of Messrs Player at Clydach"".

710124,710124,"Colwyn Bay was a growing seaside resort in the late 19th Century. The first attempt to light it were using 12 oil lamps in 1879 by the Parochial Board. A Parliamentary bill was made in 1883/84 for the formation of a gas company. The Colwyn Bay & District Gas Company was formed in 1884. A freehold of 2-acre former brickfield site was acquired from Owen Pritchard for £375 on the12th May 1884. June. First sod cut ""last week"" by William Dean of Hafod Ewryn, Colwyn Bay. (Gas and Water Review 27-6-1884). Also present was Dr. Shaw (Chairman of the Company) and most of the Directors as well as many leading residents. The entire contract has been let to Messrs Holmes & Co. of Huddersfield and the works are expected to be completed in November next. The first gasworks consisted of a Retort House with five retorts (two clay, two iron and one clay, using generator and regenerator settings), one scrubber, two condensers, two purifiers, a station meter and a 15,000 cu.ft. gasholder (Jones and Reeve 1978). David Jones, Manager. ""Colwyn Bay & District Gas & Lighting Co. Ltd., (T. J. Linekar, Secretary), offices Abergele Road (Public Hall)"" (Kelly 1895). Such was the growth of the company that an Act of Parliament was required in 1896 to extend the gasworks, with a new retort house with 37 retorts, two additional purifiers, a 60,000 cu.ft. gasholder, an exhauster and Cornish boiler (Jones and Reeve 1978). A further 250,000 gasholder cu.ft. was added in 1899.  In 1901 the company was acquired by Colwyn Bay and Colwyn UDC, it also now supplied Llysfaen. Concerns about the Gas Undertaking led to an investigation by Messrs Newbigging and Son, to look at the administration and position of the gas concern.  The report stated that the concern was well equipped and was quite capable of turning out gas economically, but it lacked good administration (Carnarvon and Denbigh Herald and North and South Wales Independent, 24th September 1909). In May 1928, an installation of 16 Glover-West continuous vertical retorts was put to work. 'Type D', capacity 1,200,000 cu.ft./day. On the, 27th February1929, the freehold site acquired on the west side of the Llanrwst-Colwyn Bay Road for £137. Glan Conway Holder Station built here; no manufacturing permitted. Vested in the Wales Gas Board from the Colwyn Bay Corporation. Following nationalisation in the Wales Gas Board in 1949, the carbonising plant was in a precarious condition. A short-term extension was made at Llandudno with mains to Conway and Colwyn Bay, Conway being closed and Colwyn Bay making a limited contribution. Colwyn Bay's annual gas production was then 349m cu.ft.. The gasworks closed in March 1956 following a supply of gas from the North Wales Gas Grid. In May 1999 it was noted that a single two-lift spiral-guided holder remained, steel tank. Appeared to be disused.

Official circulars draw attention to the many advantages of gas as a clean and effective illuminant and a handy means of cooking the family “vitals” to a turn. As showing its popularity numerous residents are ordering the service. One advantage to intending consumers is the offer by the Gas Company to fit houses with pipes, brackets, pendants, and gas stove free of charge the only condition being that you place your pennies in the slot of the meter and the coins cover the total cost of fittings and gas (The County Echo, 28th April 1904).

The gasworks were designed and built by George Bower of St. Neots. A letter was read from Mr John Aubrey, secretary of the Hirwain Gas and Coke Company, stating, with reference to the complaints of the lamps not being lit at the time stipulated, that it was owing to the changing of the retorts. Those nights were, however, light, and no complaints were made by the Hirwain people. With regard to the price, the company undertook to supply gas at the same rate as the Olu Company, viz., £ 3 3s. per lamp per annum; but owing to competition they were now supplied under the price of fair competition. £3 3s. per lamp was less than places of equal size were supplied for, and the Hirwain Company could not afford to lower the price. They hoped those explanations would be satisfactory to the Board. (The Aberdare Times 24th September 1870).

These gasworks came under the owner ship of the British Gas Light Company; also supplied Greenfield and Bagillt, and later Flint also. Mr James Williams acted as receiver and manager of the Holywell Gas Works for a period of 20 years and for a still longer period acted as secretary to the Lighting and Watching Committee. (Flintshire Observer 10th March 1871). 1880 Parliamentary Session. An attempt to take over the supply was made by the Local Board, who proposed new gas works at either Blue Mill or Greenfield. The British Gas Light Company Limited, promoted the Holywell Gas Act in 1880 to extend their power of supply at the Holywell gas Undertaking over Holywell, Whitford and Mostyn. 13th October 1881, 2.02a of land at Bagillt Marsh was transferred from the Companies Trustees (Henry Wood and another) to the Company itself.

The Holywell and Flint Gas Order of 31st July 1931. The BGL quickly laid a 6"" welded steel connecting main between Flint and Bagillt (already fed from Greenfield at low pressure) so that the two works could operate more economically. BGL also employed C.& W. Walker to build a two-lift spiral guided holder at each works. Both holders were 100,000 cu.ft. capacity. Between 1933-35 A new and modern retort house was then erected at Greenfield; production was concentrated there, and Flint gas works became a holder station c.1935. The new plant had Intermittent Vertical Chamber Ovens and was built in and above the old retort house, some of whose horizontal retorts had to be cleared. The single bench contained beds of four, two and two chambers. New (reconditioned) exhausters were placed in the new machinery room, the old exhauster house becoming a mess room and bathroom. Ancillary plant had to be relocated; some plant from Flint was re-used. The new 6"" steel main was extended from Bagillt to Greenfield and a District Governor installed at Bagillt. Holywell continued to be fed at low pressure from Greenfield. The annual gas production in 1949 was 147m cu.ft.. The Holywell gasworks closed in April 1955 following a supply of gas from the North Wales Gas Grid. Parts of the Holywell site (0.78a) sold in 1973 and 1982. The two holders at Greenfield, No.2 capacity 100,000 cu.ft. and No.3 capacity 200,000 cu.ft.. were cut off and purged in December 1997. Both were spiral-guided with above-ground tanks.

During 1964/5 three ICI Lean Gas plants using naphtha were built and put into production, each capable of producing 15m cu.ft./day. In 1967 two CRG High pressure reforming plants using naphtha were put into action. Of the 13 buildings, most had steel frames. A fire-fighting reservoir was built in the nearby hills, providing a water pressure of 100 psi. The proximity of the works to the refinery meant that less than the usual fuel storage was provided. Four floating-roof tanks; two of 40 feet diameter held 1,000 tons of light distillate fraction (LDF) 170 furnace fuel, and two of 56 feet diameter of light distillate fraction 160 feedstock, these were bunded.

When the whole of the houses and shops preparing for gas are lighted up, it is intended by one of the principal shareholders to have a little demonstration to celebrate the event, particulars of which will appear in our columns, when they take place, these gas works, we are told, are everything that the shareholders could wish, and are working in every respect most satisfactorily”. In 1858 the company was known as the Llandudno Gas and Water Company. In 1868 the Chairman of the Company was a Colonel Tottenham (He was also chair of the Llangollen gas company).  Mr Robert Price was manager of the Llandudno Gas and Water Company in 1872. Mr John Williams was the secretary to the Llandudno Gas and Water Company until his death in June 1876.  The Llandudno Improvements Act 1876 allowed the Llandudno Commissioners to purchase the Llandudno Gas and Water Company, this occurred on the 31st March 1877 (The North Wales Chronicle 7th April 1877). Plans were drawn up by the engineer Mr. Marks to improve the gasworks “Mr Marks exhibited general plans of the improvements on which he had been instructed to prepare plans, and estimates. He now read his report upon the existing buildings and apparatus, much of which the spoke of as in a most dilapidated condition, the only wonder being that with the retorts, &c., as at present, the quantity and quality of the gas produced was so good as they were. He proposed a new block of buildings which would include a new purifying house and other appliances, by which the present supply of gas could be doubled. His estimate for the whole of these works was £4100, but this was altogether independent of returns from the sale of old plant. The new works were so designed that they could be proceeded with and carried out without referring with the existing arrangements as to the supplying of town with gas” (The North Wales Express 25th January 1878). These improvements were completed in late December 1878. In 1881, Thomas T. Marks was the Manager. The local authority became an Urban District Council in 1896.

We will prove to the Householders of Llandudno that one large dinner, or two small dinners, can be cooked in Wright's Cooker's for Id. worth of Gas. Be up-to-date and make life worth living by adopting a Wright's Gas Cooker.”. Mr Thomas Davies, the Manager of the gasworks resigned in 1907. The New manager of the work gave a full description of the gasworks in June 1907 “Carbonizing Pant. —This comprises two Retort Houses and Benches, the old house measuring 44 ft. x 43 ft. and contains 5 Beds of 6 Retorts, 2,1 in. x 14 in. x 8 ft. long. These are heated on the shallow generator system, and through not working at present, I am given to understand the heating is very good. Three of the Beds are new, and two are worn out and should be renewed next year. The new Retort House and Coal Store is. 79 ft. x 60 ft. and is well arranged for present requirements. The Retort Bench contains 6 Beds of 8 Retorts (singles) with solid ends set back to the regenerative system and appear to heat satisfactorily. Two of these Beds are quite new, two have worked one year and two are worn out and require renewing this season. The total number1 of Retorts, is, 78, and last year the largest number in use was 44, leaving ample margin for some time to come. The Hydraulic Main in the old house is rather old-fashioned but quite sound the one in the new house is more modern, having separate compartments! for each Bed with separate Tar Pipes, the Foul Main runs round the four sides of the Retort House, and by its great length assists, considerably in the work of condensation. The Condenser is 29 years old, and of the old-fashioned tubular type. It consists of a rectangular base with Tar outlet, and 14 upright Pipes, 12 in. diameter, 18 ft. 'long each. It is, rather small, for the maximum days' make, but, taking into account the exceptional length of the Foul Mains, we have on the whole, a fair amount of condensing area. If, however, the make of gas increases much, it, will be advisable to consider the question of inserting a Tar Extractor. There are Two Tower Scrubbers one probably as old as the Condensers, the other about 23 years old. The former is 36 ft. high, 5 ft 6 in. diameter, but is in disuse. The newer one is 40 ft. high, 5, ft. diameter. It is fitted with the usual rough-sawn boards and has a constant flow of ammoniacal liquor passing through it. It appears to be in good condition, but rather small for present requirements, its deficiency is, however, made up by the Washer Scrubber, 12 ft. 6 in. long x 5 ft. wide. In this apparatus the last traces of ammonia are removed. Notwithstanding the capacity of the Washer Scrubber, it will be necessary if the make of gas increases, to provide a large Tower Scrubber. The Steam Boiler is of the Cornish type, 15 ft. x 5 ft., fitted with forced draught, and using Cannel, Coke and Breeze as Fuel, and Water from the Town's: supply. It is capable of doing all our work and appears to be in sound working condition. There are two sets of combined Engines and Exhausters, either of which is capable of passing all the gas, made during the present maximum day. Purifiers, these consist of eight Boxes, two 17 ft., two 14 ft., and four 8 ft square. They are worked in three sets, the, four smallest boxes being worked as two Purifiers, and are quite ample for present requirements and allow a liberal margin for increase. The Station Meter is about 14 years old; it is equal to our largest demands at present. Of the four Gas Holders three are. in use. They provide storage for nearly two days of the maximum output, which allows a good margin, and will probably serve for several years to come. The top lift of the largest Holder, which is the: last to empty, scarcely gives enough, pressure for night, consumption, but as there is ample storage! at present it causes no inconvenience. But should the output increase to any extent it. will become necessary to remedy this by adding weight to the crown. The Storage Tank used for filling Tar and Liquor Tanks, is in need of repair in several places, and some provision should be made for indicating the height of the contents which could be readily seen from the yard. In 1909, Walter Shadbolt was the Gas Manager, he submitted several schemes for replacing arc lamps with gas (high pressure or otherwise) on the promenade. (JGL 26/1/1909) In 1912	the Llandudno UDC required 7,700 tons of gas coal and 300 tons of cannel. "" (Gas Journal 7/5/1912).  Vested in the Wales Gas Board from the Llandudno UDC. At vesting in 1949, the carbonising plant at Conway was in a precarious condition. A short-term plant extension was made at Llandudno with interlinkage (largely using existing mains) from Llandudno to Conway and Colwyn Bay, Conway being closed and Colwyn Bay contributing a limited supply. Llandudno's annual gas production was 221m cu.ft. in 1949, compared with 349m cu.ft. at Colwyn Bay and 108m cu.ft. at Conway.

For some time past the approaching introduction of the gas light into this town, has caused great expectation amongst the juvenile and poorer part of the population, many of whom had only hitherto heard of its brilliancy. Their anticipations were raised greatly on seeing during Friday and Saturday, the preparations proceeding in the town for a general light-up) by eight on Saturday evening, the streets were full of people, and a shout of delight arose from the crowd when the old Town Hall looking towards Long Bridge-street appeared one galaxy of stars.in the centre of which was seen this inscription, Llanidloes Gas Company, 1859, crowned with a locomotive engine, and below, a gas burner lighted. This transparency was surrounded with a wreath of evergreens. The whole tableau had a beautiful effect. The new Town Hall also blazed forth to the people that the gas light had now become an actual reality in their town for developed with a distinctness as bright as that given by the sun at noonday, appeared the words, Success to the town and trade of Llanidloes."", “The gas-works have been erected from plans prepared and under the superintendence of Mr. George Walcott, of Abchurch Lane, London. Competent judges have pronounced them equal if not superior to any of their size in Great Britain. The contract for the buildings, apparatus, and castings were carried out in satisfactory manner by Thomas Spittle, of Newport, during the last four months (The North Wales Chronicle, 12th November 1859).  In 1867, it was reported that the gasworks were undergoing repairs and the town was without light (The Aberystwyth Observer, 1st June 1867). The Llanidloes Gas, Coal and Coke Co. Ltd. formed in 1858 and in 1859 the Company bought the business from Mr. Davies. In 1895 John D. Davies was Secretary and Thomas Munford the Manager, this was the same 1898, when the company had a capital of £2,500. In 1909 the Llanidloes Corporation, took advantage of the offer made by the Llanidloes Gas Company to supply tar free of cost for use on the roads, and began the work of improvement by filling up the holes, in the roadways with chippings and tar. They have now acted upon the suggestion made to tar the whole of the surface of the roads, which has proved a success (The Montgomeryshire Express 21st September 1909). In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Llanidloes was manufacturing 12 m cu.ft. of gas using horizontal retorts. H. J. Wright was the manager. The Llanidloes gasworks was connected to the Welshpool gasworks in 1959, which had a surplus gas supply. It was later supplied in 1960 through the Mid Wales Gas Grid from the Maelor gasworks at Wrexham, with the gasworks closing. 1961 A plan shows the old gas works between the River Severn and Victoria Avenue (Hafren Street). A new 50,000 cu.ft. holder had been built about 300 yards away and linked to the works by an 8"" main. The new site was fed by the grid main from Newtown, which continued to Rhayader. The last gasholder was demolished in 1987-89, leaving just a regulator kiosk and a garage on site. The gasworks were visible on the 1879 to 1992 OS maps.",English Description

It held its first annual meeting on 28th June 1855, when John Robert Griffith was the Secretary (The North Wales Chronicle 30th June 1855). In 1865 the company was advertised as the Llanrwst Gas Light, Coal, and Coke Company, Limited (The North Wales Chronicle 8th July 1865). In 1881 the company had a capital of £2,730 and Joseph Ashley was the Chairman and James Hughes Jones the Secretary. In 1895 the company was known as the Llanrwst Gas Co. Ltd. and James Hughes Jones was Secretary and Robert Davies, Manager, the engineer/manager had changed to F. J. Collingwood in 1898. A prospectus for the Holyhead and North Wales Gas and Water Corporation Ltd, listed that it had been formed for the purposes of purchasing the following gasworks and undertaking in Wales:  Holyhead Gasworks; Menai Bridge Gasworks; Llanrwst Gasworks; Llanberis Gasworks; Bettws-y-Coed Gasworks; Pwllheli Gasworks; Penmaenmawr Gasworks; Nantlle (Vale) Gasworks; Llanfairfechan and Aber Gasworks; and Llanberis Waterworks. The company was acquired by the Holyhead & North Wales Gas & Water Corporation Ltd. for £10,501 on the 16th April 1896, the Llanrwst Gas Co. Ltd was then wound up voluntarily. The Llanrwst Electric Lighting Order of 1900 created a rival energy business, Llanrwst Electric Light Co., which was offered for sale in 1906, to the Gas & Water Corporation, but it was losing too much money. The manager of the gasworks in 1909 was a Mr William Severs. In 1915 the annual gas production was 5m cu.ft. of 14 cp gas from 515 tons of coal. However, sales were 3,593,800 cu.ft., leaving 28% unaccounted for gas, a heavy loss. The Works Manager was E. E. Jones. He reported to Henry Talbot at Holyhead. In 1949 annual gas production was 21.8m cu.ft.. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Llanrwst was manufacturing 20m cu.ft. of gas using horizontal retorts. J. F. Wilmot was the manager. Most of the original North Wales Grid was laid by a (partly American) crew during the summer of 1955.  The Llanrwst gasworks closed in October 1957 following a supply of gas from the North Wales Gas Grid. The gasworks were visible on the 1875 to 1992 OS maps.

The gasworks featured on the 1905 OS map, which suggests, construction started earlier than 1910. c1910, a gas supply was commenced by Willey & Co., who had built the works themselves, laid the mains and no doubt made the meters. In 1914 annual gas production was 1,882,100 cu.ft. from 226 tons of coal, with 4.5 miles of mains. The local Manager was W. J. Rippin, but all other matters were handled by the owners in Exeter. In 1949 the annual gas production was 4m cu.ft. Willey & Co. continued to operate this business until nationalisation, as they did at Kidwelly. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Llanwrtyd Wells was manufacturing 3 m cu.ft. of gas using horizontal retorts and J.R. Young was the manager.  The former Manager's house was sold on the 2nd January 1976. The last gasholder was removed not long before October 1983 and six 2-ton LPG tanks were then placed immediately east of the holder base. There were already four 2-ton tanks and a Calorimeter Kiosk, so presumably the town had been converted to straight LPG.  The gasworks were visible on the 1904 to 1899 OS maps.",English Description

The masonry of the former work is contracted for by Mr. Christopher, and the latter, as well as the Station Buildings at Cemmaes Road, by Mr. John Morgans, both inhabitants of this town. Judging from the character of both contractors, we doubt not but that the work will be speedily and well executed.” The Machynlleth Gas Co. Ltd. was formed in 1864. On the 1st of December 1865, a 0.5a site was acquired to build a gasworks, however as reported the construction had started in 1863, so this may have been an extension.

On Thursday night, for the first time, our streets were lighted with gas, to commemorate this important event brilliant illuminations were displayed in the principal streets. The Maesteg brass band also turned out and played in good style a number of lively airs. It is somewhat wonderful that a place of such importance should for so long a time be without gas. Had it not been for the exertion of Mr. James Brogden in obtaining an Act of Parliament, in the face of some opposition, the Maestegians would probably be yet in darkness. The gas works are in a central position, on a spot of land belonging to Maesteg Issa farm, the property of Major Tuberville, the Chairman of the Gas Company. The (gaso)meter is 193 feet in circumference, and 16 feet 6 inches in depth and was constructed by Mr. Vickery, of Exeter. About four miles of pipes have been laid, and nearly 1,500 lights have been taken. In the Llynvi Works alone there are 350 lights, about 100 in Garth and Oakwood Collieries, 60 in Salem Chapel, 63 public lights, and nearly 400 in private dwellings. Mr. Young has been appointed the manager of the works. Mr. J. Burrow is the managing director. For some years there has been gas in Bethania Chapel. The Tin Works Company and Mr. Illtid Morgan also manufacture themselves the gas they consume.” An advert published in 1978 claimed that J. T. B. Porter & Co. of Lincoln listed Maesteg among the towns where they had built complete gas works, however, it appears to contradict the role of Mr Vickery, who may have just built the gasholder. They had their own rail sidings into the gasworks. These works belonged to the Llynfi Valley Gas Company.

They are situated on a strip of land bounded on the one side by the Cynon River, and the Taff Vale Railway (T.V.R.) on the other, at about 300 yards from the railway station. The various buildings connected with the works are divided into three sections. In entering the works by the new road, we first observe the foreman's cottage, adjoining this being the governor house, which contains two governors, a 7 inch and 9 inches, for governing the distribution of gas to Ynysybwl, Mountain Ash, and Penrbiwceiber. Passing on we come to the central block of buildings, which consists of retort house, coal stores, blacksmith's shop, manager and clerk's offices, and storeroom, &c. The retort house is a substantial structure, well lighted and ventilated, containing at present 18 retorts, but the building is so arranged as to be easily capable of extension. The coal is brought along the siding of the T.V.R. over the weighbridge into the coal stores. The gas passes from the retort house into the condensers, and from there into the exhauster house, provision being left for another exhauster. The exhauster-house forms part of the end block of building, which also include boiler washer, purifying, and meter houses; also, lime shed. The purifying-house contains four purifiers, 10ft. square. The gas then passes through the station metre into the gasholder, which is telescopic. The diameter of the gasholder is 60ft. The various buildings, which are imposing and substantial, have been erected by Messrs Batchelor and Snowden. The apparatus required in the manufacture of gas, including the gasholder, have been supplied by Messrs R. and J. Dempster, of the Gas Plant Works, Newton Heath, Manchester; and the engineers were Messrs G. W. Stevenson and Son, of London. The works are expected to produce gas by the 1st July next (1889). They are capable of producing over 30,000,000 cubic feet of gas per annum. 1945	Works at ""Penrhiwceiber"". Annual gas production 46,535,000 from 4,354 tons of coal. CV 430 BThU, plant horizontals.

710195,710195,"In 1953 an agreement was reached between the NCB and Wales Gas Board in the spring of 1953 for a supply of methane from Point of Ayr colliery, starting 1-1-1956. The colliery was unusual for the volume of firedamp (methane) released under pressure and had already collected and utilised the gas both for firing boilers and (under high compression) for fuelling a lorry. Wales Gas built the necessary reformers and compressed the output into the North Wales Grid. They expected to buy 600,000 cu.ft. of 980 Btu gas/day Under some conditions possibly 1m/day), which would be reformed to make 1.0 to 1.6m/day of town gas. Cold enrichment of Blue Water Gas was also considered. The Point of Ayr gas terminal was built adjacent to the site to collect gas from the Liverpool Bay Gas System.",English Description

Porter & Co. of Lincoln listed Pontardulais among the towns where that had built complete gas works. The advert containing this list was published in 1878. The Pontardulais Gas Works opened in August 1878, recorded in the South Wales Daily News (22nd August 1878) “The Pontardulais Gas Works was lit up for the first time on Tuesday evening. The ceremony of lighting up was performed by Miss Rees. The Witt. Among those present at the opening were Captain Dahue, Neuadd Fach, chairman of the board of directors; and Messrs White, Lliw Forge; Isaacs, Cambrian Tin Works; and Mr Jones, Upland House, secretary. The gas for I Tuesday and Wednesday was supplied free of charge, and the shops and inns, lighted up for the first time by gas. presented to the inhabitants of Pontardulais. The quality of the gas seemed to be good, and more than probable that the already large number of householders who have introduced it into their residences and business premises will on the advantages of gas light being thus plainly shown, be considerably augmented.” “Under the auspices of the Pontardulais Gas Company, a very successful gas exhibition has been held at the Public Hall during the week. Arrangements were made by the Cannon Holloware Company, Limited, to exhibit their celebrated Hercules Gas Cooker. Mrs Charles Marshall, of London, was the demonstrator” (South Wales Daily News 10th July 1897). In 1898 G. Jones was the engineer/manger and 250 tons of coal was carbonised.",English Description
710197,710197,"A new gasworks had been built in Pontardulais by 1898, as it appears on the OS map from that year. In 1906 the Pontardulais Gas Co's Order, which included to extend the supply of gas in the Parish of Ldandeilo-Talybont in the County of Glamorgan, and in the Parish of Llanedy in the County of Carmarthen, was put before parliament. In 1914 the annual gas production was 11,698,000 cu.ft. of 14 to 15cp gas from 1,332 tons of coal. The Chairman was William J. Rees and the Secretary, R. T. Jones. The gasworks were visible on 1879 OS map, not marked on 1898 OS map, but visible. Jones and Reeves reported that c1950 Pontardulais was operating a Tully complete gasification plant, which needed major repair. To enable this to happen, a CWG plant was removed from Llanelli and re-erected at Pontardulais. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Pontardulais was manufacturing 25 m cu.ft. of gas using a Tully plant and CWG plant. E.R. Frith was the engineer and manager. The gasworks closed in 1955. The gasworks were visible on the 1898 to 1980 OS maps.",English Description

The year of the sale of the Pontardawe gasworks, which was covered in the 29th April 1892 edition of the Cambrian.  “Mr. William Harry Rees, auctioneer, offered for sale by auction at the Cross Inn, Pontardawe, on Thursday, the Pontardawe Gasworks, comprising all the plant and stock. The attendance was not large. The bidding was started at £500, and ultimately the property was knocked down for £725 to Dr. Griffiths, Pontardawe, and Messrs. R. A. Browning and Hopkin Jones of Neath.” In 1899 the annual gas production was 4,250,000 ft3, Dr. G. Griffiths, was the Chairman and R. A. Browning (Neath), the Engineer, Manager & Secretary. (Gas World Directory) (Browning was Manager & Secretary of the Neath Corporation Gas Department). In 1900 the annual gas production was 4,250,000 ft3. Dr G, Griffith, was the Chairman, R.A. Browning was the Engineer & Secretary and J. Jones, Manager. (GWD&S). The Swansea Valley Gas Bill of 1907 included for the company of the 1905 Order to be transferred to the new Company. The Swansea Valley Gas Act was passed in 1908, but was opposed by the Swansea Gas Light Company and Swansea Rural Council. One of the objections was the name, so the company and act were then known as the Tawe Valley Gas Company and Act (1908). The bill included that both the Ystalyfera Gas Company and the Pontardawe Gas Company in the new Power company which had purchased them in 1905. Manually operated charging machine and improved washing plant was in introduced in 1915.  There was a further Tawe Valley Gas Order in 1926. In 1948 the Pontardawe undertaking ceased production in favour of a supply from Neath, necessitated by the demand from new factories in the area. R. Kelf-Cohen, Under-Secretary, Ministry of Fuel & Power (Gas Division) inaugurated this, the first interlinkage in West Wales and a part of the proposed South Wales Gas Grid (Gas World December 1948). The works were retained as a gasholder station.  In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Pontardawe was purchasing 71 m ft3 of town gas. J.A. Elphinstone was the engineer and manager.

710199,710199,"The site is south of the Rhymney railway and had no railway connection. The 15th August 1863 edition of the Merthyr Telegraph and General Advertiser for the Iron Districts of South Wales, Described the construction of a new gasworks in the village. The new gasworks just been completed and commenced lighting on Monday last; they have been erected by a Joint Stock Company and will prove a great boon to the inhabitants of Pontlottyn and Rhymney. The old works were not large enough for the growing requirements of the town and have been abandoned in favour of the new scheme. The light is of first-class quality, and the works, though small, are compact, neat, and replete with all the latest improvements. The gas will be charged the same price as at Merthyr and the adjoining towns, and we have no doubt the scheme will be a profitable one. The gasworks were immediately east of the bridge which gave the village of Pontlottyn its name. By 1914 the gasworks belonged to the Rhymney & Aber Valleys Gas Co. and was managed from Caerphilly. The gasworks were visible on the 1875 to 1985 OS maps.",English Description
710200,710200,"Pontypool appear to have been first lit by gas in 1841 as described in the following article “PONTYPOOL GAS LIGHTs. -The inhabitants of Pontypool have been supplied with lights in their dwellings of the most brilliant and the purest description, which have afforded general satisfaction. The speculation, however, has not sufficiently remunerated the spirited proprietor, Mr. Thomas Price, who has, at a heavy expense, laid down new pipes, and extended them beyond the limits of the town, in every direction. It is now, we understand, in contemplation, at the next general Meeting of the Board of Police, to propose a rate for the purpose of lighting the town. The carrying such a desirable object into effect is universally approved of by all those who prefer light to darkness” (Monmouthshire Merlin 16th October 1841). This suggests that at first there was no street lighting. An amended bill was passed to form the “The Pontypool Gas Light and Coke Company” in May 1850. In 1870 Mrs Lavinia Price was recorded as the propriertress of Pontypool gasworks. In 1817 the Pontypool Local Board considered purchasing the Pontypool gasworks but did not proceed with the purchase.  The annual gas production about 8 million cu.ft. in 1871. On 20-9-1871 a General Meeting of the Trevethin Water Works Co. was held at Pontypool Town Hall. The Proprietors agreed to purchase the gas works. In 1873 the Pontypool Gas & Water Co. Ltd. was formed by a Special Act which renamed the Trevethin Water Works Company thus. The new Company purchased the gas works from Mrs. Lavinia Price for £11,000. In 1883 The Pontypool Gas and Water Company, had authorised capital of £40,000, produced 14m cu.ft. of 14 cp gas from 1555 tons of coal. Mr Andrew Hair was the Manager & Secretary (The Cardiff Times 20th January 1883). In 1902 the Company considered using the methane, which was venting near Old Furnace, Pontypool. The annual gas production in 1914 was 48.6m cu.ft. from 4,550 tons of coal. 14cp, benzole enricher used. Mr T. H. Deakin JP was the chairman and T. B. Pearson the manager & secretary. In 1921 Pontypool purchased the Abersychan Gas Company under a Special Order dated 10th August 1921, which allowed the authorised capital to be increased. An 8"" welded steel main delivered coke oven gas to Clarence Street (and to Abersychan) from the Blaenavon Companies coke ovens in 1935. Gas production ceased at both Pontypool and Abersychan, late in that year. The Cwmbran Gas Company agreed on 10th January 1936 to sell their business to Pontypool. The necessary BoT Special Order was issued on 19th November. Negotiations with the Blaenavon Gas Company were reopened and a provisional agreement to sell was signed on 17th April 1936. Negotiations in hand to purchase the Usk Gas Company as well. In 1940 gas production at Pontypool was resumed due to added demand, with an CWG plant installed. In the 1940’s the Cwmbran Gas Works was converted to supply hydrogen for the Balloon Barrage, at the request of the Air Ministry. In 1943, various meetings with the Ministry of Fuel & Power led to a Special Works Order authorising a completely new gas works on a new site at Panteg. A bulk supply to the Abercarn UDC began in September 1946, bulk supplies were also given to the Brynmawr & Blaina undertaking ex-Coke Ovens at Blaenavon in the 1940’s as well. In 1949 the gasworks 1949 had an area 8,900 sq. yds. and a capacity 1m cu.ft./day ""in reserve"" after the opening of the new Panteg gasworks.

A covered bridge linked the two halves of the office block above the entrance gateway. One large spiral holder. A commemorative booklet ""Description of New Gas Works, Wales Gas Board, Pontypool Undertaking"" by J. Powdrill was issued by Wales Gas Board to mark the opening by Hugh Gaitskell MP, the Minister of Fuel & Power, on 20-10-1949. By October 1949, bulk gas supplies were being connected to Newport, Risca and Beaufort. The Blaenavon coke ovens had partially failed and were closed when supplies from these new gasworks were available. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Pontypool was manufacturing 1,183 m cu.ft. of gas using vertical retorts. J. Powdrill was the engineer and manager. The Pontypool high pressure gas network was extended from Blaenavon to Abergavenny in 1954, and further extended in 1957 to Brecon with gas recompression. A Concentrated Ammonia plant was built at the site in 1957 due to an effluent problem at the works. In 1959 the Pontypool grid area was selling 5.8m therms per year of which 68% was to industrial customers. A single 5m/day ONIA-GEGI gas reforming plant was commissioned in November/December, it used Light Distillate Fraction as a feedstock which was stored in bunded tanks. Annual gas production 1,188 m cu.ft. from 73,000 tons of coal in 1964 (Gas World Yearbook 1965). A gas supergrid offtake station was built at the site in 1965. The carbonising plant was taken out of commission In March 1967, although it was not abandoned until 1968. This was due to the new Catalytic Rich Gas plant was brought into use at the E. M.

The first works and gasholder were sited at Dyfatty on land belonging to the Swansea Corporation.  The following report from the Cambrian' dated 24th March 1821, described the lighting of the pier lighthouse “About two months since, Dr Wilkinson proposed to the Harbour Trust the lighting of Swansea Pier by means of gas and suggested that the light, to have a distinctive character, should be exhibited in the form of an anchor. This proposition was acceded to, and last week the whole was completed. The anchor is as large as the interior of the building will admit, and the figure is formed by an arrangement of sixty gas lights, the whole producing the most brilliant effect. The form of the anchor is perceived at a sufficient distance for the purposes of navigation; some sailors have stated that it exhibits a blaze of light at more than ten miles distance. The lights previously used in very foggy were almost indistinct at a short distance. The lights now adopted are intensely brilliant under every condition and will afford to vessels their required protection. From this successful experiment we sincerely hope that the lighthouses on the Mumbles, at Lundy Island etc. will be similarly arranged”.

The specification of the original gasworks was to include five of John Brunton's patent retorts, with ascension pipes, hydraulic mains, and condensing cisterns, three circular dry lime purifiers, two hydraulic valves, a gasholder, 29 feet in diameter and 12 feet deep, with guide-framing of three 6-inch iron columns and wood girders, together with pumps, water cisterns, tar-cisterns, &c. About 3000 yards of mains, varying from 4 inches to 1 inch, were laid, and 17 pillar lamps and 37 bracket lamps were erected in the streets of the town.  In May 1836, the tender of Messrs. William Lewis and Griffith Rowlands "" for building the gas-house "" was accepted the contract price being £400.  One of the earliest buildings to instal the new illuminant was the Parish Church; and the Corporation, in January 1837, generously authorized the Mayor to draw upon their funds to the extent of £30 to provide a chandelier and brackets as a present from the Council to the parish to complete the lighting of the church. In 1866, thirty years after their construction, the Council leased the gasworks to Mr. Edward Compton. In January 1867, the lease was assigned to Mr. George Wilson Stevenson, of Westminster; and during the time they were held by this gentleman the construction of an additional holder and other improvements were taken in hand. Tenby was where one of the earliest types of a continuously fed vertical retort was experimented with in the 1870s by the Mr. George Wilson Stevenson, who was then lessee of the works. A new lease for twenty-one years was granted by the Corporation in 1875; and in the following year the Tenby Gas Consumers' Company was formed for the purchase of the undertaking, the lease being assigned to them.  In 1909 Mr Alfred H. Brookman who was the manager of the Tenby Gas Consumers' Company Limited was elected as the President of the Wales and Monmouthshire District Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers. He had been connected with the Company for 33 years, during which long period he witnessed a remarkable development in the Tenby undertaking. In his presidential address he made the following remarks: “Year by year the consumption of gas steadily increased, and good dividends was paid until the expiration of the first lease in June 1896, when the output stood at 15m cu.ft., with a capital of £11,250. The corporation then approached the company with a view to purchase, and the company made them an offer to sell their undertaking for £15,000, but the corporation, after a great deal of correspondence, and many meetings, decided to lease the works for a further term of 32 years, the company paying an increased rent and a fine of £1200. The price of gas was to be regulated by a sliding scale, dependent upon the price of coal delivered at the works. Shortly after the renewal of the lease, the company erected a new purifying plant, using oxide of iron exclusively for purification. Regenerator furnaces have been adopted, which have greatly improved the working and increased the make of gas and coke per ton of coal carbonized, while the public lamps have been converted to the incandescent system. These improvements add very materially to the economical working of the concern. Nearly thirteen years of the new lease have elapsed, and during this time the company's business has steadily increased. The capital employed is £14,450, the profit for the past year being £1432, after putting aside £125 for depreciation. At present the annual output of gas is 27 m cu.ft., and the company's income last year from all sources were about £8000. The population of Tenby is about 4500. At the present time there are 850 ordinary and slot meter consumers, supplied by the company the number of public lamps is 175. The retort-house is a building 61 ft. long by 28 ft. wide and 20 ft. high. The roof is of iron and covered with slates. The louvre ventilator extends the full length of the house. The retort-bench consists of five beds of Winstanley's patent regenerator furnaces.  The coal-stores comprise two buildings and are capable of storing 800 tons of coal. The condensers are of the annular type. The underground tar and liquor storage tank is 30 feet diameter by 12 feet deep, with a storage capacity of 90 tons. In the engine-room, there are two exhausters, by Messrs. Gwynne and Beale, of the two-blade type of 10,000 and 5000 cubic feet per hour capacity.  The boiler house is 23 feet long by 16 ft. 3 in. wide and 13 feet high and contains one horizontal Cornish boiler and one egg-ended boiler.  Scrubber No. 1 is 30 feet high and 8 feet diameter, filled with boards and fitted with a Livesey patent washer at the base.  Scrubber No. 2 is 23 feet high and 3 feet diameter, filled with boards; the distributor being supplied with clean water.  The purifier building is 75 ft. long and 23 ft. wide and contains four 12 feet square water-lute boxes fixed on the stage floor, with revivifying floor below.  Gasholder No. 1 is a two-lift telescopic one with cast-iron tank, 50 feet diameter and 22 feet deep. The guide-framing consists of six cast-iron standards, connected with lattice girders. The capacity is about 85,000 cubic feet. Gasholder No. 2 is a single lift, with brick and puddle tank, 30 feet diameter and 12 feet deep. The guide-framing consists of five cast-iron standards connected together by girders, and the capacity is about 7000 cubic feet.  In 1898 the engineer/manager was A.H. Brookman and the Secretary was C.W.R Stokes, the works made 14.5m cu.ft. from 1650 tons of coal. In 1914 the gas works is Corporation property but ""worked by a Company whose lease expires in about 14 years’ time"". The Gasworks.  In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Tenby manufactured 41m cu.ft. of gas using Horizontal Retorts. W. R. Taylor was the engineer, manager, and secretary.

In 1896, the gasworks were flooded due to storms. “When Mr. Griffin, Towyn, of the Dysynni Gas Company, arrived at Aberdovey Gasworks on Sunday morning he found that there had been a considerable escape of gas. The cap on top of the gasometer had been unscrewed, causing an escape which is estimated at between 15,000 and 20,000 cubic feet” (Welsh Gazette, 1st March 1906). By 1920 the Towyn gasworks also supplied Aberdovey. The 1923 OS map shows a straight siding about 550 feet long with a facing point for southbound trains, north of the station.
