On the 22nd of August 1896, land adjoining Smith Street, including works and works house, sold to Dolgelly Gas Company. 1,286 sq. yds. for £7,500. By 1901 the gasworks had expanded eastwards with a 2nd gasholder. In 1901 Mr. Ellis Jones, manager of Dolgellau gas works. Extra land was purchased on the 8th December 1903 (170 sq. yds) and the 8th October 1904 (130 sq. yds). In 1915 Robert Woodford was manager. The Annual gas production in 1949 was 14m cu.ft.. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, recorded that Dolgellau was manufacturing 12 m cu.ft. of gas using horizontal retort plant. J.W. Lloyd was the manager. The Dolgellau gasworks was connected to the Barmouth gasworks in 1959, which had a surplus gas supply. It was later supplied in 1963 through the Mid Wales Gas Grid from the Maelor gasworks at Wrexham.  In May 1974 two holders remained in use.

85432,85432,"In 1840 the Directors of the Swansea Gas Light Company found that the Dyffaty works were too small and could not supply demand. Although the Dyfatty Gasworks served the town for many years, they were not situated in a very suitable position, especially as the town extended westwards and at a much lower level. it was decided to move the gasworks to a more strategic location to supply Swansea with gas for the future. Land called “Burrows Field No.6” on Oystermouth Road were sold by the Corporation to the Company for £150 15s on the 17th July 1841.The Dyfatty gasworks were dismantled after Oystermouth Road gasworks opened in March 1842. The gasworks site was a long-standing fixture in the city of Swansea. The original site was acquired in July 1841, a Mr. Spinney acted as consultant. The Neath Abbey Ironworks supplied gas plant to the Swansea Gas Company in 1841 (the drawings are held by the West Glamorgan Archive Service ref: GB 216 DD NAI/2/42/hub). The Swansea Gas Light Company began producing gas on the six-acre site in March 1842.
In 1844 Swansea Corporation obtained a second private act for the better paving, lighting and further improving the town. By 1867 the borough of Swansea had been greatly extended, so much so that the length of Swansea‘s streets had increased to approximately 40 miles and the number of public gas lamps to 589. In 1883 The Swansea Gas Light Company, had authorised capital of £100,000, and had in 1881 produced 155m cu.ft. of 15 cp gas from 18,461 tons of coal. (The Cardiff Times 20th January 1883). In 1890 under the direction of the then engineer/manager Mr Thornton the gasworks were further extended and updated. In March 1903 six beds of eight inclined retorts were first worked, they were built by New Conveyor Company and proved very troublesome. Two years late in 1905 six more beds of inclined retorts were built by Drakes.
In 1912 an application was made to Parliament for powers to be granted to purchase land at Morriston for the construction of a new gasworks. George Andrews was replaced by Reginald G. Clary as Engineer & Secretary in 1914. Preparations were made in 1914 to build the new gasworks at Morriston, but this was delayed by the onset of World War One, the only works carried out were the levelling and drainage of the site. The first gas showroom was opened in in 1914 on Wind Street. The construction of the gasholder at Morriston commenced in 1919. Mr W. H. Johns was appointed Engineer and Manager to the company in 1920, he had an important role in the awarding of contracts, deciding types of plant and generally overseeing the construction of the new Morriston gasworks. The new gasworks consisted of a machine charged Horizontal Retort House, housing 140 retorts all ancillary plant and a new power house. A Carburetted Water Gas plant was built to supplement coal gas production and meet peak demand. The New Morriston gasworks were commissioned and became fully operational in 1924, with the Oystermouth gasworks closing in 1925. The Carburetted Water Gas was shut down later in March 1927. The retort houses and No.1 gasholder demolished in 1936. 
On the 19th February 1941 an incendiary device landed on one of the gas holders at Oystermouth Road Setting it on fire. Mr George Peters and Mr Johnny Thompson, foreman, scaled the gasholder and extinguished the flame with wet clay, for which the George Medal and British Empire Medal respectively. At its peak, the site housed four gasholders which stored and distributed gas from the site. The other three survived until nationalisation and into the Wales Gas era. The gasworks were visible on the 1880 to 1993 OS maps.",English Description
419686,419686,"February 29th, 1884, construction ""coming on satisfactorily"" with the holder tank almost ready and holder being erected. Debentures worth £12,500 issued to cover the costs of the new works. The new gasworks were described in the Weekly Mail of the 21st of June 1884, “These works at Crindau have now made such progress as to permit of the foundation stone being laid, and this ceremony took place just after noon on Tuesday, the stone being laid by Mr. Thomas Gratrex, chairman of the board of directors. The first section of the new gasworks at Crindau consists of retort house, 147ft. long inside, by 65ft in width. Adjoining and parallel with it is the coal store, of same length, and 40ft. wide. The nature of the sloping ground which has been excavated for these buildings has been here taken advantage of for the construction of the sidings which will stand immediately above the coal store, running on the natural level of the side land, and will thus enable the coal to be discharged by means of shoots direct into the coal store with very little labour. There will be two stacks of retorts, containing in all 144 mouth pieces. For the present only one of these stacks will be erected, and the other will be erected as the demand for gas requires it. The condensers, which will be of wrought iron, scrubbers, washers, and tar tank will be erected in proportion with the capacity of the retort house just described. These have not yet been commenced but will be put in hand very shortly. The purifying house is 147ft. in length and 62ft. wide. There will be six purifiers 20ft. square each, four for oxide and two for lime. The building for engine-house will be 82ft. long by 40ft. in width, and boiler-house 40ft. by 35ft. The meter and governor-house follow these buildings. The diameter of the gas holder tank is 120ft., and its depth from top of coping to paving of tank bottom is 25ft 7in. The holder will hold 500,000ft. of gas when filled. The holder is a strong construction and, to meet the exigencies of a somewhat exposed situation, the framing consists of fourteen cast-iron columns with two rows of neat wrought iron lattice girders. The mains laid into town are 24in. in diameter. The whole of the buildings will be in red brick with blue facings, excepting key stones, sills, and coping, which will be of Forest stone. The roofs will be of wrought iron. Space has been left for the erection of another retort-house, as also space for two additional gasholders. Should these be found necessary the works would be in a position to turn out about 1,750,000 cubic feet of gas per 24 hours. The works are being erected to the designs and under the superintendence of Mr. Canning, engineer to the company. The contractors for the building are Messrs. Henry Hilton and Son, of Birmingham, and for the iron roofs Messrs. Willey and Co., Exeter. The gas holder is being erected by Messrs. Pigott. of Birmingham, and the tank by Messrs. White and Co., Evesham. The foundation stone was laid in the purifying house, where a platform and awning had been erected.”.  An advert by Biggs, Wall & Co from 1906 for manual charging machines (stop-ended horizontal retorts) says a repeat order was supplied to Newport. An urgent need for economy in municipal affairs was stressed by Mr. J. H. Canning, Junior Vice-President of the Institution of Gas Engineers and engineer and manager of the Newport (Mon.) Gas Company in 1930. Coke oven gas from Bedwas was first received on 10th December 1935 through a 12"" high pressure main which ended at the inlet to purifiers at Crindau. Gas manufacture ended except for the CWG plants at Crindau, which were kept for peak load use. In 1949 arrangements were in hand to take a bulk supply from Pontypool.  Vested in the Wales Gas Board from the Newport (Monmouth) Gas Company.  In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Newport was manufacturing 50 m cu.ft. of gas using CWG plant and purchasing 1,152m cu.ft. of coke oven gas. J.F. Rust was the engineer and manager. The site was Used by British Gas up until the 1990's the complex was demolished, and a supermarket was built on the site in 2010. The gasworks were visible on the 1900 to 1995 OS maps.",English Description

The stone was laid by Miss Llewellin, the daughter of Mr. Llewellin, late mayor of Newport. A large number of persons were present to witness the ceremony, and the evening was kept in true holiday style. The engineer of the works is Mr. T. D. Steele, of Newport, who has successfully carried out similar works in other parts of the country.”. This is a later date than that proposed for their construction by George Bower of St. Neots (1863). Operated as the  Caerleon Gas Company Ltd. In 1883, M. M. Cope was Chairman. T. Dyne Steel, C.E., Engineer (as at Cwmbran) and F. Grant, Secretary, it had a Capital of £3,000. In June 1884, there were rumours that the Company would amalgamate with Newport were reported in the Gas & Waterworks Review. The Newport Gas Bill of 1886 included a clause to extend the limits of the company's supply, it enables them to purchase lands by agreement, to purchase the undertaking of the  Caerleon  Gas Company, and to raise additional capital to the amount of £72,000, with borrowing powers to the extent of £ 18,000.  (South Wales Echo 28th  January 1886). In 1898 The manager and secretary were Mr J. Flemming, the works carbonised 400 tons of coal, but the amount of gas produced was not stated. In 1899-1900 the Newport Gas Company attempted to take over the Caerleon gasworks, this was a hostile takeover, not wanted by Caerleon. At this time A Williams Esq was the chairman of the Caerleon Gas Company. In 1901, Thomas Canning prepared a report for the Newport (Mon.) Gas Company entitled “Report on Gas Supply to Caerleon”. This report mentioned that the Caerleon Gas Company would pass into the hands of the Newport Gas Company on the 31st of March 1902. The Purchase of the works being agreed at £2,800 with £100 already paid. The report also discusses the various schemes of providing gas to Caerleon and the problems encountered. He recommended that two potential routes could be adopted for building a pipeline from the Crindau Gasworks in Newport to Caerleon. The Act of 1902 empowered the Newport Gas Company to purchase the Caerleon Gas Company, the takeover occurred on the 25th of March 1902 (from the Newport (Mon gas Company 1843-1943).  From the minute on the 11th of April 1902 that the gasworks at Caerleon were visited and were found to be in a very bad and depreciated condition, it was requested that an inventory of the plant be drawn up and offered for sale. An Extraordinary general meeting of the members of the Caerleon Gas Company (Limited), recently held at Caerleon. It was resolved and duly confirmed that the company be wound up voluntarily Evening Express 15th March 1902). 25th March 1902 Conveyance Caerleon Gas Company Ltd its Liquidation to Newport (Mon) gas Company. The governor at Caerleon was found to be defective, so Newport ordered a new governor for the gasworks from J&J Braddock. Circa July 15th, 1902, there was an explosion within the Caerleon gas network as a Mr Simms had claimed for damages from the explosion. The gasworks closed in 1902 and a specification for 11 tons of old iron was prepared from the Caerleon gasworks, the engineer was requested to invite tenders for sale by 15th of October. 6 tenders were received for the old iron at the Caerleon gasworks.

The gasworks were visible on the 1923 to 1995 OS maps.",English Description
309650,309650,"The Gas Company was established in 1824 and was promoted in part by the Mayor of Newport a Mr William Brewer Esq. The Mill Street site was secured and on the 4th of March 1825, Mr. Breillat of Bristol, was superintend the entire work of reconstruction for the lump sum of £100.  Ten public lights and were kept lit with gas from 29th September 1825 for one year.  Gas Lighting appears to have been ?rst introduced in Newport was 11th November 1825. Mr William Morgan was the first engineer to the company. Mr. J. Morgan, one of the proprietors, and the conducting manager of the gasworks at Newport in 1826. A Town Hall meeting was called in 1844, due to the poor quality and high price of gas (Monmouthshire Merlin 20th January 1844). In 1843 a Special Act was passed to incorporate the Newport Gas Company, which had a Capital of £9000 split into 360 shares and powers to raise additional capital of £6000. NEWPORT GAS WORKS —In addition to the ten gas ovens at these works, the company are erecting three others, which will enable the contractor to supply a sufficiency of gas for the demands of this rising town. Other improvements at these works are in progression, under the vigilant and experienced eye of one of the proprietors, - a gentleman to whom the town is much indebted” (Monmouthshire Merlin 3rd August 1850). THE NEWPORT GAS WORKS. - A new gasometer has been added to these works, capable of containing sixty thousand cubic feet of gas, which, in addition to the forty thousand in the old gasometer, will be more than sufficient for the present demand, which does not exceed 50,000 feet per day, it will not be found too large when the town of Newport has increased to its anticipated extent. The NEW gasometer Was constructed by Mr. Vicary, of Exeter, and the work proceeded under the superintendence of Mr. Bryan, the secretary of the company. The process of filling with water has been going on during the week, and the gasometer will be in full operation in a few days (Monmouthshire Merlin 5th May 1854). In 1857 considerable extensions of plant were put in hand including a new retort house and a new gasholder and tank, while at the same time considerable extensions of mains were carried out. At this period the Manager’s house was built.  Mr. Joseph Brian was manager of the Newport Gas Works in 1858, the same year a new gasholder was brought into use. In December 1872, there was a gas leak in the purifying house from one of the purifiers, which was ignited, the explosion injuring 11 people “South Wales Daily News 6th December 1872). In 1877 the manager of the gasworks was Thomas Canning. There was another explosion in the purifier house in December 1878. In 1883 The Newport (Mon) Gas Company, had authorised share capital of £90,000, in 1881 it had made 119m cu.ft. 15 cp gas from 13,185 tons of coal. (The Cardiff Times 20th January 1883). In 1883 the Capital was £65,000 and Thomas Gratrex, Chairman, Thomas Canning the Engineer and Edward F. Marfleet the Secretary.  Vested in the Wales Gas Board from the Newport (Monmouth) Gas Company. The Mill Street gasworks was replaced by the Crindua gasworks. The gasworks were visible on the 1882 to 1973 OS maps.",English Description
308241,308241,"The works at Grangetown were opened in 1863, when the population of Cardiff was approximately 33,000. “The new Gasworks are now in working operation and seem to be constructed with an eye to economy, convenience, and all the modern appliances and improvements” reported the Cardiff Times from March 10th, 1865.  The Grangetown gasworks were marked on the 1880 OS maps and town plans, they had two gasholders at this time. The gasworks were being extended in 1869 according to a report in the Cardiff Times from the 4th September 1869. In 1893 a stage-floor horizontal retort house was built, with 21 regenerative settings of eight D twenty-foot throughs. Benches and ironwork by R&J Dempster Ltd. ""The number of retorts did not justify mechanisation"". A railway incline led into the coal stores on either side; discharge was also to both sides. ""Another demonstration of the facility with which shipping may be dealt with at Penarth Dock took place recently when a steamer arrived with a cargo of 1,495 tons of gas coal for the Cardiff Gas Company. She entered the dock at 1 p.m. and the work of discharging was commenced immediately. The vessel was afterwards placed under the new tips in the basin. While here she took on board 2,070 tons of coal, the whole process of unloading and loading being completed in only 17.5 hours"". (Coal Merchant and Shipper 12/4/1902) In 1907	the 1893 retort house was extended and fully mechanised by John Aird & Sons, Wests (conveyors and compressed air charging/discharging machines and capstans) and Drakes (retort benches). A further 14 settings of eights were built by Drakes, making 560 mouthpieces in a building 427 feet by 68 feet wide. South end boarded for future extension. Conveyors took coke to a 400-ton overhead hopper intended primarily for the rapid loading of railway wagons with coke. At this time there were still about sixty beds of direct-fired retorts of various ages, some still in use, along the western boundary. These were coaled manually from ground-level sidings. An installation of 80 'Type A' G-W continuous vertical retorts was commissioned in December 1914, it had a capacity of 2,520,000 cu.ft./day. By 1949 the demand for gas from the Undertaking had increased from 12 to 17 million Therms per annum. Gas Production ceased in June 1973 but continued to provide a butane additive to the supply to reduced dependence on the national gas system.

For the Buildings and Tanks complete. 3rdly. For the excavating of the Trenches in the Streets for the Cast Iron Gas Pipes.”. A gas company called the Menai Bridge Gas and Coke Company was formed in 1859. The gasworks was built on land which became known as Gasworks Field, the contractors were believed to W. C. Holmes of Huddersfield, who listed it as a town they had built a gasworks. On the 9th of August 1873, the business was offered for sale as a ""working plant” by the Menai Bridge Gas & Coke Company. It included “one Gasometer, one Purifier, three Retorts, Governor, the whole of the excellent service pipes, etc., etc. The works are conveniently situated, commodious, in good. order, and include a capital Dwelling House for the Gasman. The average consumption of gas is close upon 1,000,000 feet per annum” The North Wales Chronicle and Advertiser for the Principality, 26th July 1873. In 1881	the company had a Capital £1,950. From 1885, the gasworks supplied Menai Bridge with gas to light the streets at night, initially in winter only. In 1886 Robert Algeo CE obtained a Provisional Order to maintain and continue gasworks, and to make and supply gas to Menai Bridge and other places in the parish of Llaudysilio, the capital not to exceed about £8000 The North Wales Chronicle 15th May 1886), on obtaining the order he took over the undertaking. On the 12th February 1897 the undertaking was acquired by the Holyhead & North Wales Gas & Water Corporation Ltd. from Robert Algeo. for £3,500. Quoted elsewhere as 16th April 1896 for £4,537.) In 1898 the gasworks engineer was R. Alger, and it was producing 1,250,000 cu.ft. of gas from 195 tons of coal. The arrangement shown on the 1899 OS was unchanged in 1913. In 1949 the annual gas production was 7m cu.ft.. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that   Menai Bridge was manufacturing 7 m cu.ft. of gas using horizontal retorts. W. H. James was the manager. In the year 1952 a bulk supply was being received from Bangor as part of a minor integration scheme which also involved Bethesda and Beaumaris and the gasworks closed.

September 3rd, 1868.” The Lampeter gas works were built in 1869: coal was brought to the works by the newly constructed Manchester and Milford Railway. Gas was later produced by the ""Lampeter, Llandysul, Tregaron and Aberaeron Gas Company"" implying that gas was distributed widely.  J. T. B. Porter & Co. of Lincoln listed 'Aberaeron' among the towns where they had built complete gas works. The advert containing this list was published in 1878. The company placed an advert to lease the gasworks in July 1877 (South Wales Daily News, 9th July 1877). In 1883 The Lampeter, Llandysul, Tregaron & Aberayron Gas Company, had authorised capital of £2,000, in 1881 it had made 14 cp gas from 91 tons of coal. (The Cardiff Times 20th January 1883). In 1898, the engineer/manager of the gasworks was Evan Thomas and the secretary John Lloyd, at which point they were making 747,000 cu.ft. of gas from 90 tons of coal. In 1908 Mr. Evan Thomas was the manager of the Lampeter Gas Works. In 1949 the Lampeter, Llandysul, Tregaron & Aberayron Gas Company was producing 11m cu.ft. at the gasworks in Lampeter, K. E. Tiddy was the Engineer, General Manager & Secretary. Vested in the Wales Gas Board from the Lampeter, Llandysul, Tregaron and Aberaeron Gas Company. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Lampeter was manufacturing 14 m cu.ft. of gas using horizontal retort plant. W. M. Young was the manager. The Lampeter gasworks closed in 1958, when gas was then supplied through an extension of the South Wales Gas Grid. A plan held in the NGGA dated 1967, but probably earlier, shows the site to consist of a retort house, engine house, purifier, main tar well, workshops and stores. Mess room, test room, garage, stores, No.1 and No.2 gasholders. The gasworks were visible on the 1887 to 1974 OS maps.",English Description
301649,301649,"The Porthcawl Gaslight & Coke Co. Company was formed 1867. J. T. B. Porter & Co. of Lincoln listed Porthcawl among the towns where they had built complete gas works. The advert containing this list was published in 1878. “The tender of the Porthcawl Gas Company for erecting 23 lamps and maintaining gas, lighting at dusk, and extinguishing at 11 p.m. every evening, at £4 19s 6d per lamp per annum (the lamps at the expiration of the five years to become the property of the board) was accepted” (The Cardiff Times 16th September 1893). The South Wales Daily News of 23rd of February 1899 reported “NEW GAS-MAKING APPLIANCES FOR PORTHCAWL. The directors of the Porthcawl Gas Company have decided to extend their works, and called in Mr S. J. H. Willey, gas engineer, of the firm of Willey and Co., who have offices at Cardiff, to advise them thereon. Acting under this gentleman's recommendation, they have decided to have new purifiers, new condensers, new scrubber, and an additional setting of five retorts, with all the necessary connections, which work they have entrusted to the firm of Willey and Co., civil and gas engineers of London, Exeter, Plymouth, Swansea, and Newport”.  The manager of the Porthcawl Gasworks, Mr. William Collins was appointed the manager of the gasworks at Coquimbo, Chile in 1910.  In 1912 the company sought powers in the 1913 Session to dissolve and reincorporate as the Porthcawl & District Gas & Electricity Company, to establish Electricity Works and to repeal powers of the Llynvi Valley Gas Act 1868 as far as they relate to gas supplies to Newton Nottage. The Porthcawl and District Gas Company was purchased c1915 by the Council in Porthcawl, that year the respected gas engineer Mr Ferguson Bell was to examine the works on behalf of the council to suggest improvements. In 1923 a Tully gas plant of a capacity 200,000 cu.ft./day was included in a list of such plants supplied by Tully Gas Plants Ltd., Newark, between 1919 and September 1923.  Porthcawl and District Gas Co. The gasworks were rail served by a spur from the nearby GWR Porthcawl Branch.  In September 1933, an installation of three Glover-West continuous vertical retorts was put to work, 'Type E' retorts 50"" x 25'long with a capacity 270,000 cu.ft./day. The annual gas production was then less than 45m. The three new retorts were each independent settings whose output could vary from 50,000 cu.ft. to 100,000 cu.ft./day each; they shared two producers. The brickwork of the retort house was brought out to conceal the steel frame, and the gables were stepped, S. Walker was Gas Engineer & Manager when the plant was built. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Porthcawl was manufacturing no gas although it was still shown as having vertical retort, it was purchasing 3 m cu.ft. of town gas and 106 cu.ft. coke oven gas. H. Short was the engineer and manager. In 1973 it was noted that Porthcawl still had a gas-powered lighthouse at the end of the Porthcawl Breakwater, operated by Ogwr Borough Council. The gasworks were visible on the 1880 to 1988 OS maps.

305480,305480,"In 1841 Owen Owen Roberts was one of three men deputed to arrange for the adoption of the Lighting and Watching of Parishes Act. He had been much involved in starting Caernarvon's gas supply and had moved to Bangor in 1836. His interest was in promoting public order. In September 1843 the gasworks was completed. In 1854 a SA amalgamated the Bangor Gas Company and the Bangor Water Company. In 1878 the purchase of the Bangor Gas & Water Companies business was authorised by the Bangor Local Board Act. In 1879 The Board acquired the gas works. In 1895 Thomas Newbiggin was brought in to resolve a long-standing dispute between different parties at how the gasworks were run, Mr T. G. William, Mr John Williams and Mr Robert Owen led by Mr Henry Lewis against the manager (Mr Smith) of the gasworks. In 1898 John Smith was the manager, Owen Smith the secretary and the annual gas production was 39m cu.ft., with 34m cu.ft.  of gas sold. In 1934 the National Gas Council drew attention to the condition of the Bangor and Bethesda undertakings and suggested that Holyhead & North Wales should consider their purchase. At vesting in 1949 the Bangor annual gas production was 85m cu.ft. The production plant was ""not satisfactory”, and a new works was considered at Port Dinorwic. ""The site at Bangor was limited in size and in such a position that there would have been strong local opposition to the building of a new plant on the site."" The plant was partially rebuilt for a ten-year life and a supply given to Menai Bridge, Beaumaris, and Bethesda. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Bangor was manufacturing 90m cu.ft. of gas using horizontal retort plant. J. R. Wood was the engineer and manager. The Bangor gasworks closed in February 1956 following a supply of gas from the North Wales Gas Grid. The site was retained as a gasholder station and features on the OS maps from 1888 to 1983.

91657,91657,"Following Henry Woodall advice as consultant in 1895, a new site for a gasworks should be sought and the gasworks were eventually moved to a new site in Llanbadarn out of the town.  A sidings agreement was obtained by 1898 with the Cambrian Railway Co. this agreement would have been for the new gasworks which were built adjacent to the railway in Llanbadarn. By 1902 the original gasworks had closed. In 1913 the annual gas production was 55m cu.ft. from 4,654 tons of coal. A Tully gas plant was installed in 1923 with of capacity 200,000 cu.ft. /day, it was included in a list of such plants supplied by Tully Gas Plants Ltd., Newark, between 1919 and September 1923. In 1924 a new gasholder of capacity 200,000 cu.ft.  was built at Llanbadarn, the total cost £9,000 (GW 1924). A W-D Vertical retort house was installed in 1927. In 1949 the annual gas production was 134m cu.ft.. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Aberystwyth was manufacturing 159m cu.ft. of gas using vertical retort plant. I.W. Thomas was the engineer and manager. Gas production ceased in 1962 when a westward extension of the Mid-Wales Gas Grid from Newport via Machynlleth opened. The site was retained as a gasholder station and features on OS maps from 1904 to 1995.  ",English Description
