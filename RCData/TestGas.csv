710074,710074,710074,Abercarn Gas Works,No preference,Abercarn,Caerphilly,Glamorgan,31/07/2022,DWT,31/07/2022,DWT,"The original gasworks was on Dan-Y-Rhiw terrace, which had consisted of a horizontal retort house and two gasholders, one of which was later used as an underground tar and liquor tank. The site expanded across the River Ebbw, where two larger gasholders were built, both having a 250,000 capacity. 
The Western Mail from the 21st of November 1876 reported on the formation of the company” On the 25th of January last the Abercarn and Newbridge Gas and Water Company, Limited, was formed to supply Abercarn and Newbridge with gas and water. The subject had been several times mooted, for the district was known to be growing, and both gas and water were felt to be requisites which could not be done without. A few earnest men connected with the district put their heads together, and, after some encouragement was given to the project by Lady Llanover, the company was formed on the day above named. The capital was fixed at £10,000 in 2,000 shares of £5 each.”,” Half-an-acre of land was purchased from Lady Llanover, on advantageous terms, between Hall's Tramway and the river Ebbw”,” Mr. Dyne Steel designed the works, which have been built most substantially, and with every necessary for increasing their capacity when the time arrives. The works consist of a retort house, 23ft. 6ins. by 25ft., and has accommodation for three benches of live retorts each. At present eight retorts are at work, leaving the remainder for future extension. From the retorts the gas passes into the condenser and scrubber. The gasholder is 46ffc. diameter, and 12ft. deep, and is equal to a very large consumption of gas. The mains are graduated from seven to two inches in diameter, according to the position they occupy. The mains have been carried along the roads, with the permission of the highway authorities and the overseers. Mr. Robert Roberts, of Newport, has carried out the buildings in a satisfactory manner, the stone for which has been obtained from the Pennant rock at Abercarn, the quoins and arches being of fire bricks. The gas-making plant has been supplied by Messrs. Porter and Company, Lincoln, and has been, well set up by Mr. E. Woodthorpe, their agent. The retort mouth pieces are Tangye's patent. The mains were made by Mr. Charles Jordan, of Newport, and they were laid by Mr. Jesse Bailey, of Abercarn.”. The company being promoted by the Abercarn Colliery and the Tinplate Works. The contractor for the gasworks was Charles Jordan of Newport and the laying of the gas mains was contracted to Jesse Bailey of the Abercarn Colliery, who was also active in procuring lamp posts for the company.  The Abercarn & Newbridge Gas & Water Company Ltd. was incorporated by a SA in 1884. At this time J. T. Green was the Chairman and David Bowen, the Secretary of the company. 'Abercarn & Newbridge' were one of the towns where the gas engineers J. T. B. Porter & Co. of Lincoln listed that they had built complete gasworks, in an advert published in 1878. 
By 1900 the company was making 17m cu.ft. from 2,285 tons of coal annually and supplying 214 consumers and 200 public gas lamps, through 8 miles of mains. Charles Jones was the Manager and David Bowen, the Secretary.
A SA of 1902 enabled the Abercarn UDC to purchase the company. The council run gas department was making 38m cu.ft. of gas per year from 3,368 tons of coal, supplied via a rail siding into the works from the GWR. Thomas Wilkinson was both the Engineer & Manager. Between 1919 and 1923 two Tully gas plants, each capable of producing 150,000 cu.ft./day of gas were supplied by Tully Gas Plants Ltd., Newark, according to a company advert dated Sept 1923. In 1946 a Bulk Supply Agreement was signed with the Pontypool Gas & Water Co. and an 8"" high pressure main was laid to Abercarn from Cwmbran, which was itself fed from Pontypool. Much of the gas came from coke ovens at Blaenavon.
By 1947 the amount of gas purchased (46m cu.ft.) was greater than that made at the gasworks (27m cu.ft.). By 1949, the year the gas industry was nationalised 84m cu.ft. of gas was being purchased, although the gasworks still had Horizontal retorts. T. Wilkinson was the Engineer, Manager & Secretary for the undertaking. The undertaking was vested in the Wales Gas Board in 1949 following nationalisation. In 1952 the “Gas World Year Book”, showed that Abercarn was purchasing 160m cu.ft. of gas from other works and no gas manufacture was being undertaken. T. Wilkinson was the engineer, manager & secretary. The gasholders were still in operation in 1983. Photographs of the gasworks and later gasholder station in 1983 survive at the National Grid Gas Archive.   An additional gasholder is present on south side of river by 1916 (321226,195062) were present until 1993. Original site gone by 1981. The gasworks were visible on the OS maps from 1879 to 1993.",English Description,Documents,Not Applicable,ST2123195159,POINT (-3.1399065 51.649685),,19th Century,No Preference,Not Applicable,Grid reference taken at centre of site,ST29NW,ST2195,,,,,,Gas Works,No Preference,Not Applicable,,,
